The Crashing Blow!
What is the Crashing Blow?
What will explain to you what the Crashing Blow is?
On a Day when people will be like scattered moths
and the mountains like tufts of wool,
the one whose good deeds are heavy on the scales
will have a pleasant life,
but the one whose good deeds are light
will have the Bottomless Pit for his home––
what will explain to you what that is?––
a blazing fire.
