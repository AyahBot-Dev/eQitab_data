He frowned and turned away,
when the blind man came to him.
How would you know? Perhaps he might be purified,
or he might take heed and benefit from the reminder?
But he who was indifferent,
you give him your full attention,
although you are not to be blamed if he does not purify himself.
But as for the one who came to you striving [for purification],
and he fears Allah,
you let yourself to be distracted from him.
No indeed; this is a reminder –
so whoever wills may give heed to it –
on venerable pages,
exalted and purified,
[preserved] in the hands of angel-scribes,
honorable and obedient.
Woe to man; how ungrateful he is!
From what did He create him?
He created him from a drop of semen and proportioned him,
then He made the way easy for him;
then He caused him to die and be buried;
then when He wills, He will resurrect him.
Yet he has not fulfilled what He commanded him.
Let man consider the food he eats:
How We poured down rainwater in torrents,
and caused the soil to split open [for sprouts],
and cause grains to grow in it,
as well as grapes and fodder,
and olive trees and date palms,
and dense orchards,
and fruits and grass,
as provision for you and your livestock.
But when the Deafening Blast comes,
on that Day everyone will flee from his sibling,
and from his mother and father,
and from his wife and children.
On that day, everyone will have enough concern of his own.
On that Day, some faces will be bright,
cheerful and rejoicing;
while other faces will be dust-stained,
covered in darkness.
Such are the disbelievers, the wicked.
