Hā Mīm.
By the clear Book.
Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed night, for We give warning.
On that night, every matter of wisdom is determined
by Our command. We have always sent messengers.
as a mercy from your Lord. He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing,
Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, if only you had sure faith.
None has the right to be worshiped except Him, Who gives life and causes death – your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers.
But they are in doubt, amusing themselves.
So wait for a day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke,
that will overwhelm the people. This is a painful punishment!
[They will cry,] “Our Lord, remove the punishment from us; we will surely believe!”
How will they take heed, when a messenger who explained things clearly has already come to them?
Then they turned away from him and said, “[He is] a madman, taught by others.”
We shall hold the punishment back for a while, but you will surely return [to disbelief].
On the Day when We seize [them] with the greatest assault, We will surely exact retribution.
Indeed, We tested the people of Pharaoh before them, when a noble messenger came to them,
[saying], “Hand over to me the slaves of Allah. I am indeed a trustworthy messenger to you,
and do not be arrogant towards Allah. I have certainly come to you with a clear proof.
And I certainly seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me to death.
If you do not believe me, then leave me alone.”
Then he called upon his Lord, “These are a wicked people”.
[Allah said], “Leave along with My slaves by night; you will surely be pursued.
And leave the sea parted; for they are surely an army destined to drown.”
[Imagine] how many gardens and springs they left behind,
and crops and splendid mansions,
and luxuries they used to rejoice therein.
So it was; and We made another people inherit all that.
Neither the heaven nor earth wept for them, nor were they given any respite.
Thus did We save the Children of Israel from the humiliating punishment,
from Pharaoh. He was indeed arrogant who transgressed all bounds.
We chose them with knowledge above all others.
And We gave them signs in which there was a clear test.
Indeed, these [Makkans] say,
“There is nothing after our first death, and we will not be resurrected,
then bring back our forefathers if you are truthful.”
Are they better [in power] or the people of Tubba‘ and those who were before them? We destroyed them, for they were truly wicked.
We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them for amusement.
We have not created them except for a true purpose, but most of them do not know.
Indeed, the Day of Judgment is the time appointed for them all,
the Day when no friend will avail another in the least, nor will they be helped,
except those to whom Allah shows mercy. He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
Indeed, the tree of Zaqqūm
will be the food of the sinful,
like molten metal that will boil in their bellies
like the boiling of scalding water.
[It will be said], “Seize him and drag him into the midst of the Blazing Fire.
Then pour over his head the torment of scalding water.”
“Taste this. You are surely the mighty and honorable!
This is what you [all] used to doubt.”
Indeed, the righteous will be in a safe place,
in gardens and springs,
wearing fine silk and heavy brocade, facing one another.
So it will be, and We will marry them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.
They will call therein for every kind of fruit, safe and secure.
They will not taste death therein except the first death, and He will protect them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire,
as a grace from your Lord. That is the supreme triumph.
We have made this [Qur’an] easy in your own language, so that they may take heed.
Then wait; they too are waiting.
