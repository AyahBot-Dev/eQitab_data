When the hypocrites come to you, they say, “We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah” And Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars.
They have taken their oaths as a shield in order to hinder people from the way of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do!
That is because they believed, then disbelieved; therefore their hearts have been sealed, so they do not understand.
When you see them, their outward appearance pleases you, and when they speak, you listen to what they say. But they are like planks of wood leaned [against the wall]. They deem every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?
When it is said to them, “Come, so that the Messenger of Allah may seek forgiveness for you”, they shake their heads, and you see them turning away in arrogance.
It is the same to them whether you seek forgiveness for them or not, Allah will never forgive them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wicked people.
They are those who say, “Do not spend on those who are with Allah’s Messenger so that they may desert him. But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and earth, but the hypocrites do not understand.
They say, “When we return to Madinah, the mightier will surely expel the weaker therefrom.” In fact, all might belongs to Allah and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know.
O you who believe, do not let your wealth and your children distract you from Allah’s remembrance. For whoever does that, it is they who are the losers.
And spend from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you, then he would say, “My Lord, If only You had delayed me for a short while, so that I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.”
But Allah will never delay a soul when its appointed time comes, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
