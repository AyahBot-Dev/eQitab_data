By the fig and the olive [of Jerusalem],
and by Mount Sinai [of Egypt],
and by this secure city [of Makkah],
Surely We have created man in the best form,
then We will reduce him to the lowest of the low,
except those who believe and do righteous deeds; they will have a never-ending reward.
Then, what makes you deny the Judgment Day?
Is not Allah the Most Just of all judges?
