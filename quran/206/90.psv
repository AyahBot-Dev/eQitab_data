I do swear by this city [of Makkah] –
and you are free of restriction [for a while] in this city –
and by every parent and offspring,
We have created man in hardship.
Does he think that none can ever have power over him?
He says, “I have squandered enormous wealth!”
Does he think that no one sees him?
Have We not given him two eyes,
and a tongue and two lips,
and shown him the two ways [of right and wrong]?
Yet he did not make his way through the steep path,
and how do you know what the steep path is?
It is freeing a slave,
or giving food on a day of hunger,
to an orphan relative,
or to a needy person in misery,
then [most importantly] to be one of those who believe and exhort one another to patience and exhort one another to compassion.
Such are the people of the Right.
As for those who reject Our signs, they are the people of the Left,
who will be locked up in the Fire.
