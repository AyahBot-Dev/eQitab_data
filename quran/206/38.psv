Sād. By the Qur’an, full of reminder,
yet those who disbelieve are in arrogance and dissension.
How many generations We destroyed before them; they cried out when it was too late for deliverance.
They wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves, and the disbelievers say, “This is a magician and a liar!
Has he made all gods into one God? Indeed, this is something strange!”
The leaders among them departed, saying, “Carry on as you are, and stay faithful to your gods. Indeed, there is a motive behind it.
We have not heard of this in the last religion. This is nothing but a fabrication.
Has the Reminder been sent down to him from among us?” Rather, they are in doubt about My Reminder, for they have not yet tasted My punishment.
Or do they possess the treasuries of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Mighty, the Bestower?
Or do they have the dominion of the heavens and earth and all that is between them? Then let them ascend by any means.
This is only a small army among several armies that will soon be defeated.
Before them, the people of Noah, ‘Ād, and mighty Pharaoh rejected [their prophets];
and Thamūd and the people of Lot, and the dwellers of the Forest – such were the [denier] parties.
Each of them rejected their messenger, therefore My punishment became inevitable.
They are only waiting for a single Blast that cannot be stopped.
They say, “Our Lord, hasten for us our share [of punishment] before the Day of Reckoning.”
Bear with patience whatever they say, and remember Our slave David, the man of strength who constantly turned [to Allah].
We subjected the mountains to join him in glorifying Allah in the evening and the morning,
and the birds, in their flocks; they all would echo his praise.
We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment [and speech].
Has there come to you the story of the adversaries, when they climbed the wall of his chamber?
When they entered upon David, he was frightened. They said, “Do not be afraid. We are two adversaries: one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with fairness, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the straight path.
This is my brother. He has ninety-nine ewes while I have only one. He said, ‘Give her into my charge,’ and he overpowered me in speech.”
David said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his flock. Indeed, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds – and how few they are.” Then David realized that We were only testing him, so he asked his Lord for forgiveness, fell down bowing, and turned to Him in repentance.
So We forgave that for him, and he certainly has a place of nearness to Us and a good place of return.
“O David, We have made you a ruler on earth, so judge between people with justice, and do not follow your desires lest they lead you astray from Allah’s way. Those who go astray from Allah’s way will have a severe punishment because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning.”
We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in vain. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve. So woe to the disbelievers from the Fire!
Should We make those who believe and do righteous deeds equal to those who spread corruption on earth? Or should We make the righteous equal to the wicked?
This is a blessed Book that We have sent down to you [O Prophet] so that they may reflect upon its verses, and so that people of understanding may take heed.
We gave David Solomon, an excellent and faithful slave who constantly turned [to Us].
One evening, well-trained and swift horses of noble breed were presented before him.
He then said, “I gave preference to the love of fine things over the remembrance of my Lord,” until the sun went out of sight.
[He ordered], “Bring them back to me,” and he began striking [their] shanks and necks.
Indeed, We tested Solomon and cast upon his throne a body, then he turned [to Allah].
He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom, the like of which will never be granted to anyone after me. You are indeed the Bestower.”
So We subjected to him the wind blowing gently by his command to wherever he wished,
And [We subjected to him] the devils, all kinds of builders and divers,
and others bound in chains.
[We said], “This is Our gift, so give freely or withhold, without account.”
And he certainly has a status of nearness to Us and a good place of return.
And remember Our slave Job, when he cried out to his Lord, “Indeed, Satan has afflicted me with hardship and pain.”
[Allah said], “Stamp [the ground] with your foot: here is a cool spring for bathing and drinking.”
And We restored his family to him and the like of them as a mercy from Us and as a reminder for people of understanding.
[We said], “Take a bunch of grass in your hand, and strike [your wife] with it, and do not break your oath.” We truly found him patient – an excellent and faithful slave he was. He constantly turned [to Us].
Remember Our slaves: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – men of strength and insight.
We chose them exclusively for the remembrance of the Final Home.
Indeed, they are before us among the chosen and best ones.
Also remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhul-Kifl – all were among the best.
This is a reminder. And the righteous will surely have a good return:
Gardens of Eternity, with gates wide open for them.
They will recline therein, calling for abundant fruit and drink.
And they will have maidens of modest gaze and equal age.
This is what you are promised for the Day of Account.
Indeed, this is Our provision [for the righteous] that will never cease.
This [is so]. But the transgressors will surely have a worst return:
Hell, where they will burn. What a terrible resting place!
Let them taste this: scalding water and pus,
and other similar [torments] of various kinds.
[The misleaders will say], “Here is a crowd of people being thrown in with you. There is no welcome for them; they will surely burn in the Fire.”
They will say, “No, it is you for whom there is no welcome! You brought this on us. What a terrible place to settle in!”
They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought this on us, give him double punishment in the Fire.”
They will say, “Why do we not see those whom we considered to be among the wicked?
Is it that we mistakenly made fun of them, or do our eyes fail to see them [in the Fire]?”
This is certainly true that the people of the Fire will dispute among themselves.
Say [O Prophet], “I am only a warner, and none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, the One, the Subjugator,
Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, the All-Mighty, Most Forgiving.”
Say, “This [Qur’an] is of great importance
from which you are turning away.”
[And say], “I had no knowledge of the highest assembly [of angels] when they were disputing [about Adam].
I have only received revelation in order to give a clear warning.”
[Remember] when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from clay.
When I completed his creation and breathed into him of My [created] soul, fall down in prostration to him.”
Then the angels fell down in prostration all together,
except Iblīs, who was arrogant and became one of the disbelievers.
[Allah] said, “O Iblīs, what prevented you from prostrating to whom I created with My two Hands? Did you just became proud or have you always been arrogant?”
He said, “I am better than him: You created me from fire and created him from clay.”
[Allah] said, “Then get out of here, for you are accursed,
and My curse will be upon you until the Day of Judgment.”
He said, “My Lord, then give me respite until the Day of their resurrection.”
Allah said, “You are given respite,
until the Day of the appointed time.”
Iblīs said, “By Your Might, I will surely mislead them all,
except Your chosen slaves among them.”
Allah said, “This truth is – and I only say the truth –
that I will certainly fill Hell with you and those of them who follow you all together.”
Say [O Prophet], “I do not ask you for any reward for it, nor do I pretend to be what I am not.
It is only a reminder for all people.
And you will surely know its truth after a while.”
