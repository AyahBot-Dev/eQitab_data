Woe to every backbiter and slanderer,
who amasses wealth and counts it over and again,
thinking that his wealth will make him live forever.
No indeed! He will surely be cast into the Crushing Fire,
and how do you know what the Crushing Fire is?
It is the kindled Fire of Allah,
which reaches the hearts.
It will be closed down upon them,
locked with towering columns.
