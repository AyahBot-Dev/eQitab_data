By those [winds] sent forth in succession,
those that blow violently,
and scatter [rainclouds] far and wide,
And by those [angels] who bring criterion;
and those who deliver revelation,
leaving no excuse or giving warning –
what you are promised will surely come to pass.
So when the stars are extinguished,
and when the sky is split apart,
and when the mountains are blown away,
and when the messengers are summoned,
until which Day has all this been postponed?
Until the Day of Judgment.
How do you know what the Day of Judgment is?
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
Did We not destroy the earlier nations?
Then We will do likewise to the later ones.
This is how We deal with the wicked.
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
Did We not create you from a worthless fluid,
then We placed it in a secure repository
for a determined period?
For We determined it; How excellently We determine!
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
Have We not made the earth a receptacle
for the living and the dead,
and placed therein firm towering mountains, and given you fresh water to drink?
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
[They will be told,] “Proceed to that [Fire] which you used to deny!
Proceed to the shadow [of smoke] ascending in three columns,
that provides neither shade nor protection from the flames.
Indeed, it [Hell] throws up sparks as big as castles,
as if they were tawny camels.
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
On that Day they won’t speak,
nor will they be allowed to make excuses.
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
[They will be told,] “This is the Day of Judgment: We have gathered you along with the earlier generations.
So if you have any scheme, then plot it against Me.”
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
Indeed, the righteous will be amid shades and springs
and will have whatever fruit they desire.
[They will be told,] “Eat and drink joyfully, as a reward for what you used to do.”
This is how We reward those who do good.
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
“Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while; you are truly wicked.”
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
When it is said to them, “Bow [in prayer]”, they do not bow.
Woe on that Day to the deniers!
In which message after this [Qur’an] will they believe?
