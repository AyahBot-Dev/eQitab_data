Has there come to you the story of the Overwhelming Event?
On that Day, some faces will be humiliated,
toiling and weary,
as they burn in a scorching Fire.
They will be made to drink from a boiling spring,
and they will have no food except bitter thorny plants,
that neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger.
Other faces on that Day will be joyful,
well-pleased with their past striving,
in an elevated garden,
wherein no idle talk will be heard.
There will be a flowing spring;
and couches raised high,
and cups placed ready,
and cushions lined up,
and splendid carpets spread out.
Do they not reflect on the camel, how it is created;
and the sky, how it is raised high;
and the mountains, how they are firmly set up;
and the earth, how it is spread out?
So remind [O Prophet]; your duty is only to remind;
you are not assigned to compel them.
But whoever turns away and disbelieves,
Allah will inflict upon him the greatest punishment.
Indeed, to Us is their return,
then it is for Us to call them to account.
