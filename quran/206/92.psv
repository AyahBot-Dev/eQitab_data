By the night when it covers,
and by the day when it appears,
and by His creation of male and female,
surely your efforts are divergent.
As for the one who gives in charity and fears Allah,
and truly believes in the best reward,
We will make easy for him the way of salvation.
But as for the one who is miserly and deems himself self-sufficient,
and denies the best reward,
We will make easy for him the way of perdition.
His wealth will be of no avail to him when he tumbles [into Hell].
Indeed, it is upon Us to show the right way,
and surely to Us belong the Hereafter and the present life.
So I warn you of a raging Fire,
none will enter it except the most wretched,
who denied and turned away.
But the most righteous will be saved from it,
who spends his wealth to purify himself,
not in return for someoneâ€™s favors,
but to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High.
He will surely be well pleased.
