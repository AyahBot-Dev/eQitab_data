Was there not a period of time when man was not a thing [even] mentioned?
Indeed, We created man from a drop of mixed fluids, in order to test him. So We gave him hearing and sight.
Indeed, We showed him the way, whether he is grateful or ungrateful.
We have surely prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a Blazing Fire.
Indeed, the righteous will drink from a cup [of wine] flavored with camphor,
a spring from which Allah’s slaves will drink, which will flow as they wish.
They fulfill their vows and fear a Day whose evil will spread far and wide,
and they give food, despite their love for it, to the needy, the orphans, and the captives,
[saying to themselves] “We feed you only for the sake of Allah; we seek from you neither reward nor gratitude.
We fear from our Lord a grim and distressful Day.”
So Allah will protect them from the evil of that Day, and will grant them radiance and delight,
and will reward them for their perseverance with Paradise and garments of silk.
They will recline therein on adorned couches; neither feeling scorching heat nor freezing cold.
with shady branches spread above them, and clusters of fruit will be made within their reach.
They will be served frequently with silver vessels and crystal cups,
crystalline goblets of silver, filled precisely as desired.
They will be given a glass [of wine] flavored with ginger
from a spring therein called Salsabīl.
They will be served by eternal young boys; if you see them, you would think that they are scattered pearls.
If you were to look around, you would see bliss and a vast dominion.
They will be dressed in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a pure drink.
[And they will be told,] “Indeed, this is your reward, and your efforts have been appreciated.”
Indeed, it is We Who have sent down the Qur’an to you in stages.
So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not obey any sinner or disbeliever from among them.
And remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening,
and prostrate to Him at night, and glorify Him at length by night.
Indeed, these [pagans] love this fleeting life and pay no heed to a heavy Day ahead of them.
It is We Who created them and strengthened their build. If We will, We can replace them with others like them.
Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who wills may take a way to his Lord.
But you cannot will unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
He admits whom He wills into His mercy, but for the wrongdoers He has prepared a painful punishment.
