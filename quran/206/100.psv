By the galloping, panting horses,
striking sparks of fire [with their hooves],
launching raids at dawn,
stirring up thereby clouds of dust,
plunging thereby into the midst of the enemy,
indeed, man is very ungrateful to his Lord –
and he himself is a witness to that –
and he is truly extreme in his love of wealth.
Does he not know that the contents of graves will be overturned,
and the secrets of the hearts will be brought to light?
Indeed, their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day.
