By the winds that scatters [dust],
and by the heavily-laden clouds with water,
and by the ships that sail with ease,
and by the angels who distribute [blessings] by His command.
Indeed, what you are promised is true,
and the Judgment will surely come to pass.
By the heaven with its pathways,
Indeed, you [Makkans] have conflicting views [about the truth].
He who is diverted from it is destined to be diverted.
Doomed are those who base their beliefs on conjecture.
those who are steeped in ignorance heedlessly.
They ask [mockingly], “When is the Day of Judgment?”
It is the Day when they will be punished by the Fire.
[It will be said], “Taste your punishment! This is what you were seeking to hasten.”
Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and springs,
receiving what their Lord will give them, for they were indeed doers of good beforehand.
They used to sleep but little at night,
and before dawn they would seek forgiveness,
and in their wealth, there was a share for the beggar and the destitute.
On earth there are signs for those who are certain in faith,
and also in your own selves. Do you not see?
And in the heaven is your provision and all that you are promised.
By the Lord of the heaven and earth, this [resurrection] is certainly as true as the fact that you can speak.
Has there come to you the story of Abraham’s honored guests?
When they came to him and said, “Peace.” He said, “Upon you be peace.” [saying to himself] “Unknown people!”
Then he went quickly to his household, and came with a fat [roasted] calf,
and placed it before them and said, “Will you not eat?”
He perceived a fear of them. They said, “Do not be afraid,” and gave him glad tidings of a knowledgeable son.
His wife cried out loud, and struck her face [in astonishment] and said, “[I am] a barren old woman!”
They said, “This is what your Lord said. Indeed, He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing.”
Abraham said, “Then what is your mission, O messengers?”
They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people,
to send down upon them stones of clay,
marked by your Lord for the transgressors.”
We brought out those believers who were there,
but We only found in it one Muslim household [Lot's family].
And We left there a sign [as a lesson] for those who fear the painful punishment.
And [there is a sign in the story of] Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with compelling proofs,
But he and his supporters turned away, and he said about [Moses], “A magician or a madman!”
So We seized him and his soldiers, and cast them into the sea while he was blameworthy.
And [there is a sign in the story of] ‘Ād, when We sent against them the devastating barren wind.
It spared nothing it came upon except that it reduced it to ruin and decay.
And [there is a sign in the story of] Thamūd, when they were told, “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”
But they rebelled against the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt seized them, while they were looking on.
They could not withstand it, nor could they ward it off.
And the people of Noah [were also destroyed] before them. They were indeed a rebellious people.
We built the heaven with might, and We are indeed expanding it.
And We spread out the earth. How well did We smooth it out!
And We have created everything in pairs, so that you may take heed.
So flee to Allah. Indeed, I am a clear warner to you from Him.
And do not set up another god with Allah. Indeed, I am a clear warner to you from Him.”
Likewise, no messenger came to those before them without being told: “A magician, or a madman!”
Did they suggest this to one another? Rather they are a transgressing people.
So turn away from them [O Prophet], for you are not to blame.
But keep reminding them, for reminder benefits the believers.
I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.
I seek no provision from them, nor do I want them to feed Me.
Indeed, it is Allah Who is the All-Provider, Lord of Power, the Mighty.
Indeed, those who do wrong will have a share [of [punishment] like that of their predecessors, so let them not ask Me to hasten it.
So woe to those who disbelieve from [the punishment of] the Day which they are promised.
