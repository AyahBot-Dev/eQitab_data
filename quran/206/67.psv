Blessed is He in Whose hand is the dominion, and He is Most Capable of all things.
Who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deeds, and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Forgiving.
Who created seven heavens one above another; you will not see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate. Look again; can you see any flaw?
Then look again and again; your sight will turn back to you humbled and weary.
We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and have made them as missiles to stone the devils, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blazing Fire.
For those who disbelieve in their Lord there will be the punishment of Hell. What a terrible destination!
When they are thrown in it, they will hear its roaring as it boils up,
almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is thrown in it, its keepers will ask them, “Did there not come to you a warner?”
They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has not sent down anything; you are greatly misguided.’”
And they will say, “If only we had listened or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of the Blazing Fire.”
Thus they will confess their sins. So away with the dwellers of the Blazing Fire!
Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and a great reward.
Whether you speak secretly or openly, He is All-Knowing of that which is in the hearts.
Does He not know His Own creation, when He is the Most Subtle, the All-Aware?
It is He Who made the earth smooth for you, so travel through its regions and eat from His provisions. And to Him is the resurrection.
Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to sink with you, then suddenly convulse?
Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not send against you a storm of stones? Only then would you know how [serious] My warning was!
Those who came before them rejected [the messengers]; then how severe was My response!
Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out and folding in their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. He is indeed All-Seeing of everything.
Which is your army that can come to your aid against the Most Compassionate? The disbelievers are in utter delusion.
Who is there to give you provision if He withholds His provision? Yet they persist in arrogance and aversion.
Who is better guided: the one who walks stumbling and falling on his face or the one who walks upright on a straight path?
Say, “It is He Who brought you into being and gave you hearing, sight, and hearts; little do you give thanks.”
Say, “It is He Who has dispersed you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.”
They say: “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”
Say, “That knowledge is with Allah alone, and I am only a clear warner.”
Then when they see it approaching closer, the faces of the disbelievers will be distressed, and it will be said, “This is what you were asking for.”
Say, “What do you think, if Allah causes me and those who are with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”
Say, “He is the Most Compassionate; we believe in Him and put our trust in Him. You will come to know who is clearly misguided.”
Say, “What do you think, if your water were to sink deep into the earth, who can bring you flowing water?”
