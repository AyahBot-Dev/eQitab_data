Say, “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened [to the Qur’an,] and they said, ‘Indeed, we have heard a wondrous recitation
that guides to the right way, so we have believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord.
And that He – our exalted and glorified Lord – has neither taken a wife nor a child;
and that the fool among us [Satan] used to say outrageous things about Allah,
although we thought that humans and jinn would never tell lies about Allah.
And there were some men who used to seek refuge with some jinn, but they only increased them in burden.
They thought, just like you [jinn] thought that Allah would never send any messenger.
We have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fire.
We used to take up positions there for eavesdropping, but now anyone who eavesdrops will find a flaming fire waiting for him.
We do not know whether evil is intended for those on earth, or their Lord intends good for them.
Among us are some who are righteous and some who are otherwise, for we follow divergent ways.
We have realized that we can never escape Allah on earth, nor can we ever escape Him by fleeing.
When we heard the guidance [of the Qur’an], we believed in it. Whoever believes in his Lord will have no fear of curtailment [from his reward] or injustice.
Among us are some who are Muslims and some who are deviant. Those who accepted Islam have sought the true guidance,
but those who are deviant, they will be fuel for Hell.’”
“If they had remained steadfast on the right way, We would have given them abundant rain,
as a test for them. But whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will make him suffer an arduous punishment.
The mosques are for Allah alone, so do not supplicate anyone along with Allah.
Yet when the slave of Allah stood up supplicating Him, they swarmed around him.”
Say [O Prophet], “I only supplicate my Lord and I do not associate anyone with Him.”
Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit you.”
Say, “None can ever protect me from Allah [if I should disobey Him], nor can I ever find a refuge other than Him.
I only convey what I receive from Allah and His messages.” And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger will certainly be in the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever.
Until when they see what they were promised, they will realize who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number.
Say, “I do not know if what you are promised is near or my Lord has appointed a distant time for it.
[He is] Knower of the unseen, He does not reveal His unseen to anyone,
except the messenger whom He chooses, then He appoints angel-guards before him and behind him
to ensure that the messengers fully conveyed the messages of their Lord. He encompasses in His knowledge all about them, and keeps count of all things.”
