Indeed, We have given you [O Prophet] a clear victory,
so that Allah may forgive you your previous and future sins, complete His favor upon you, and guide you to a straight path,
and so that Allah may help you with a mighty victory.
It is He Who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they may increase in faith along with their faith. To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
So that He may admit the believing men and women to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and absolve them of their sins; that is a supreme triumph before Allah.
And so that He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheist men and women, who harbor about Allah evil thoughts. An evil fate will befall them. Allah is angry with them, and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell. What a terrible destination!
To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
Indeed, We have sent you [O prophet] as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner,
so that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger, support and revere him, and glorify Him morning and evening.
Those who pledge allegiance to you [O Prophet] are indeed pledging allegiance to Allah; Allah’s Hand is over their hands. Whoever breaks his pledge, he only breaks it to his own detriment, but whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will give him a great reward.
Those of the Bedouins who lagged behind will say to you, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and our families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can prevent Allah if He intends to harm or benefit you? Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever, and that was made appealing in your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, for you are a doomed people.”
Whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, We have certainly prepared for the disbelievers a Blazing Fire.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Those who lagged behind will say when you set out to collect the spoils of war, “Let us follow you.” They wish to change the word of Allah. Say, “You will never follow us; this is what Allah has already decreed.” They will then say, “Rather, you are jealous of us.” Rather, they do not understand but a little.
Say to the Bedouins who lagged behind, “You will be called against a people of great might, whom you will fight unless they submit. Then if you obey, Allah will give you a goodly reward, but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will afflict you with a painful punishment.
There is no blame on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick [for remaining behind]. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away, He will afflict him with a painful punishment.
Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you [O Prophet] under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent victory,
and abundant spoils of war they will gain. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
Allah has promised you abundant spoils of war that you will gain, and He has hastened for you this [victory], and He has restrained people’s hands from you, so that it may be a sign for the believers, and so that He may guide you to a straight path.
And there are other [spoils] that you have not yet been able to gain, but Allah has full control over them, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.
If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would surely turn their backs, then they would not have any protector or helper.
Such was the way of Allah in the past, and you will not find any change in Allah’s way.
It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them [in Hudaibiyah] near Mecca, after giving you the upper hand over them. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.
It is they who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque, and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. If it had not been for the believing men and women whom you could not identify, so you might have trampled them and thus incurring guilt unknowingly, [We would have let you march to Makkah]. [This was] so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills. If they had been distinct [from the disbelievers], We would have surely inflicted on those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.
When the disbelievers harbored pride in their hearts – the pride of ignorance – then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and caused them to adhere to the word of piety [declaration of faith], for they were more deserving and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
Indeed, Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s dream in truth: that you will surely enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah wills, in peace and safety, and you will have your heads shaved or shortened, without any fear. He knew what you did not know, and He granted you prior to that an imminent conquest.
It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, to make it prevail over all religions, and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are firm against the disbelievers and compassionate among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking Allah’s grace and pleasure. Their distinguishing sign is on their faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is like that of a seed that sprouts its shoot, then makes it strong; then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem, which delights the sowers – so that He may enrage thereby the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward.
