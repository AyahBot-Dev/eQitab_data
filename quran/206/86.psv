By the sky and the night comer –
and how do you know what the night comer is?
It is the star of piercing brightness –
there is no soul except that there is a watcher over it.
Let man reflect on what he was created from.
He was created from a spurting fluid,
emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.
Indeed, Allah is able to bring him back to life.
On the Day when all secrets will be disclosed,
he will then have no power, nor any helper.
By the sky and its recurring rain,
and by the earth that cracks open [with the sprout of plants],
Indeed, this [Qur’an] is a decisive word,
which is not for amusement.
Indeed, they are devising a plan.
I am too devising a plan.
So bear with the disbelievers, and respite them for a while.
