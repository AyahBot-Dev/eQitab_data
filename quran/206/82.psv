When the sky breaks apart.
and when the stars fall, scattered,
and when the seas burst forth,
and when the graves are overturned,
then each soul will come to know what it has done or what it has left undone.
O mankind, what has lured you away from your Lord, the Most Generous,
Who created you, then shaped and proportioned you,
and assembled you in whatever form He willed?
No indeed; but you deny the Judgment Day,
while there are watchers over you,
honorable scribes,
who know whatever you do.
Indeed, the righteous will be in Bliss,
and the wicked will be in the Blazing Fire,
which they will enter on Judgment Day,
and will never come out of it.
How do you know what Judgment Day is?
Again, how do you know what Judgment Day is?
It is the Day when no soul will be of any help to another, and all command on that Day will be with Allah.
