By those who pull out [evil souls] harshly,
and by those who draw out [good souls] gently,
and by those who glide swiftly,
and those who overtake one another as in a race,
and those who carry out the command [of Allah],
on the Day when the earth convulses [by the first Blast],
followed by the second Blast,
hearts will be pounding on that Day,
and their eyes will be downcast.
They say, “Will we be brought back to life,
after we have turned into decayed bones?”
They say, “Then that would surely be a losing return!”
It will only be a single Blast,
then they will immediately be above the ground.
Has there come to you the story of Moses,
when his Lord called out to him at the sacred valley of Tuwa?
[Saying,] “Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed all bounds”.
And say: ‘Are you willing to be purified,
and I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear Him?’”
Then Moses showed him the greatest sign.
But Pharaoh denied it and disobeyed.
Then he turned back striving to plot.
He gathered [his people] and proclaimed,
saying, “I am your lord, the most high.”
So Allah seized him for an exemplary punishment in this life and in the Hereafter.
Indeed, there is a lesson in this for those who fear Allah.
Are you more difficult to create or the heaven that He built?
He raised it high and proportioned it,
and darkened its night and brought forth its daylight.
And thereafter He spread out the earth,
brought forth from it its water and its pasture,
and set the mountains firmly,
as a provision for you and your grazing livestock.
But when the Supreme Calamity comes,
on that Day man will remember all what he did,
and the Blazing Fire will be exposed for all to see.
As for those who transgressed,
and preferred the life of this world,
the Blazing Fire will be their abode.
But those who feared standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from evil desires,
Paradise will surely be their abode.
They ask you concerning the Hour, “When will it be?”
How could you possibly mention that?
Its knowledge rests only with your Lord.
You are only a warner for those who fear it.
On the Day when they see it, it will be as if they had remained [in this world] no more than an evening or a morning.
