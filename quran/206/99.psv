When the earth is shaken with a mighty quake,
and the earth throws out its burdens,
and man says, “What is the matter with it?”
On that Day it will recount all its news,
because your Lord has inspired it [to do so].
On that Day all people will come forward in separate groups to be shown their deeds.
So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,
and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.
