The Striking Calamity!
What is the Striking Calamity?
How do you know what the Striking Calamity is?
On that Day people will be like scattered moths,
and the mountains will be like carded wool.
Then the one whose scales of good deeds are heavy,
will have a pleasant life.
But the one whose scales of good deeds are light,
his abode will be the abyss.
And how do you know what it is?
It is a Blazing Fire.
