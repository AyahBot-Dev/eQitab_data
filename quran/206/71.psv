Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, “Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment.”
He said: “O my people, indeed I am a clear warner to you,
that you worship Allah and fear Him, and obey me;
He will forgive you some of your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed, when Allah’s appointed term comes, it cannot be delayed, if you only knew!”
He said, “My Lord, I have surely called my people night and day,
but my call only drove them further away.
Every time I call them so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears and cover their faces with their garments, and persist in obstinacy and grow extremely arrogant.
Then I called them openly,
then I addressed them in public and in private,
I said, ‘Seek forgiveness from your Lord. Indeed, He is Most Forgiving.
He will shower you with abundant rain from the sky,
and He will give you wealth and children, and bestow upon you gardens and rivers.
What is the matter with you that you do not fear the Majesty of Allah,
when He has created you in stages?
Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens, one above another,
and has placed the moon therein as a light and the sun as a burning lamp?
Allah has produced you from the earth like a plant,
then He will return you into it, and then will bring you out again.
Allah has made the earth wide spread for you
so that you may tread its spacious paths.’”
Noah said, “My Lord, they have disobeyed me and followed those whose wealth and children did not increase them except in loss.
They have contrived a mighty plot,
They said, ‘Do not abandon your gods; and do not abandon Wadd, Suwā‘, Yaghūth, Ya‘ūq, and Nasr.’
They have led many astray. So [O Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error.”
Because of their sins they were drowned and then were cast into the Fire, and they did not find any helpers against Allah.
Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave on earth a single disbeliever.
For if You leave them, they will surely lead Your slaves astray and beget none but wicked disbelievers.
My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and whoever enters my house as a believer, and all the believing men and women, and do not increase the wrongdoers except in ruin.”
