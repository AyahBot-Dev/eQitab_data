I swear by the Day of Resurrection,
and I swear by the self-reproaching soul!
Does man think that We cannot reassemble his bones?
In fact, We are able to restore even his very fingertips.
But man desires to persists in his evil ways,
and asks [mockingly], “When is the Day of Resurrection?”
But when eyes are dazzled,
and the moon is darkened,
and the sun and the moon are brought together,
on that Day man will say, “Where is the escape?”
No indeed! There will be no refuge.
On that Day all will end up before your Lord.
On that Day man will be informed of what he has sent forth and left behind.
In fact, man will be a witness against himself,
despite the excuses he may put forward.
Do not move your tongue [O Prophet] in haste trying to memorize it.
It is upon Us to make you memorize and recite it.
Then when We recite it [through Gabriel], follow its recitation attentively;
then it is upon Us to explain its meanings.
No indeed! You [people] love this fleeting world,
and neglect the Hereafter.
On that Day some faces will be bright,
looking at their Lord.
And on that Day, some faces will be gloomy,
knowing that a crushing calamity will befall them.
Indeed, when the soul reaches the throat,
and it is said, “Is there any healer?”
And he realizes that it is time to depart,
when legs are brought together [in a shroud];
on that Day, he will be driven to your Lord.
He neither believed nor prayed;
rather he denied and turned away,
then went swaggering to his people,
Woe to you [O man], and woe!
Again, woe to you, and woe!
Does man think that he will be left neglected?
Was he not once a drop of semen emitted,
then he became a clinging clot, then He created him and perfected his form,
and made from him both genders, male and female?
Is not He able to bring the dead back to life?
