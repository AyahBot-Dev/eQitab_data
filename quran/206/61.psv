All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?
It is most loathsome to Allah that you say what you do not do.
Indeed, Allah loves those who fight in His way in firm ranks, as if they were a solid structure.
And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, why do you hurt me when you know that I am a messenger of Allah to you?” So when they chose to deviate, Allah caused their hearts to deviate, for Allah does not guide the rebellious people.
And [remember] when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Children of Israel, I am truly a messenger of Allah to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving glad tidings of a messenger after me whose name will be Ahmad.” But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is clear magic.”
Who could be more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah when invited to Islam? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
They wish to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will complete His light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.
It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it prevail over all religions, even though the polytheists may dislike it.
O you who believe, shall I tell you about a trade that will save you from a painful punishment?
It is to believe in Allah and His Messenger, and to struggle in the way of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if only you knew.
He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of Eternity. That is the supreme triumph.
And [He will grant you] another favor that you love: help from Allah and an imminent conquest. Give glad tidings to the believers.
O you who believe, be supporters of Allah’s cause, as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples, “Who will be my supporters for Allah’s cause?” The disciples said, “We are the supporters for Allah’s cause.” Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and another disbelieved. We then supported those who believed against their enemies, so they prevailed.
