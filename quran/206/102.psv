Competition for worldly gains distracts you [from Allah],
until you come to your graves.
No indeed! You will come to know.
Again no! You will come to know.
No indeed! If only you knew for certain.
You will surely see the Blazing Fire,
Again, you will see it with absolute certainty.
Then on that Day you will surely be asked about your worldly pleasures.
