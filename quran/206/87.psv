Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
Who created and fashioned in due proportion,
and Who determined [the creation] then guided them,
and Who brings forth the pasture,
then makes it into withered chaff.
We will teach you [the Qur’an], so you will not forget,
except what Allah wills, for indeed He knows what is manifest and what is hidden.
We will guide you to the easy way.
So remind, if the reminder should benefit.
He who fears Allah will take heed,
but the wretched will avoid it,
who will enter the Great Fire,
wherein he will neither die nor live.
Indeed, he who purifies himself will attain success,
and remembers his Lord’s Name and prays.
But you prefer the life of this world,
even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
Indeed, this was in the earlier Scriptures,
the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
