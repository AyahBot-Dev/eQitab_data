Woe to the defrauders,
those who take full measure when they take from others,
but they give less when they measure or weigh for them.
Do they really not think that they will be resurrected
for a momentous Day,
a Day when people will stand before the Lord of the worlds?
No indeed! The record of the wicked is surely in Sijjīn.
How do you know what Sijjīn is?
It is a clearly inscribed Record.
Woe on that Day to the deniers,
those who deny the Judgment Day!
None denies it except every sinful transgressor.
When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables!”
No indeed! Their hearts have been stained by what they used to commit!
No indeed! On that Day they will be barred from seeing their Lord.
They will then surely enter the Blazing Fire,
then they will be told, “This is what you used to deny.”
No indeed! The record of the righteous is certainly in ‘illiyyīn –
and how do you know what ‘illiyyūn is? –
It is a record inscribed,
witnessed by those who are close to Allah.
Indeed, the righteous will be in Bliss,
seated on the couches, gazing in wonder.
You will see on their faces the radiance of bliss.
They will be served to drink pure wine from a sealed container,
whose last sip is musk – let those who strive, strive for that –
and it will be mixed with water from the spring of Tasnīm,
a spring from which those who are close to Allah will drink.
Indeed, the wicked used to laugh at the believers;
when they passed by them, they would wink at one another,
and when they went back to their people, they would return exulting.
When they saw the believers, they would say, “These people are truly misguided,”
although they were not sent as their keepers.
So Today the believers will laugh at the disbelievers,
while sitting on the couches, gazing around.
Have the disbelievers been rewarded except for what they used to do?
