By the mount of Tūr,
and by the Book inscribed
on an unrolled parchment,
and by the much-frequented House [in heaven],
and by the canopy raised high,
and by the sea ever filled.
The punishment of your Lord will surely come to pass;
there is none who can avert it.
On the Day when the heaven will convulse violently,
and the mountains will move a horrible movement,
then woe to the deniers on that Day,
those who amuse themselves in falsehood.
On the Day when they will be shoved into the Fire forcefully,
[They will be told,] “This is the Fire which you used to deny.
Is this [punishment] magic, or do you not see?
Burn in it, whether you bear it patiently or impatiently, it makes no difference to you; you are recompensed only for what you used to do.”
Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and bliss,
enjoying what their Lord has given them, and their Lord protected them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire.
“Eat and drink pleasantly for what you used to do,
reclining on lined up couches”. And We will marry them to houris of wide beautiful eyes.
As for those who believe and their offspring follow them in faith, We will cause their offspring to join them, and will not detract anything from [the reward of] their deeds. Everyone will be accountable for what he earned.
And We will provide them with whatever fruit and meat they desire.
They will pass around to one another a glass [of pure wine] which does not lead to idle talk or sin.
They will be served by their servant boys, as if they were well-protected pearls.
They will turn to one another with questions.
They will say, “Before this, we used to be in awe [of Allah] when we were living among our people.
Therefore Allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire.
Indeed, we used to call upon Him before. He is indeed the Most Kind, Most Merciful.”
So keep exhorting [O Prophet], for you are not, by the grace of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman.
Or do they say: “He is a poet for whom we await a misfortune”?
Say, “Wait, I too am waiting with you.”
Do their minds prompt them to say such things, or are they a transgressing people?
Or do they say, “He has made it [the Qur’an] up”? Rather, they are not willing to believe.
Then let them produce a discourse like this, if they are truthful.
Were they created by none, or were they the creators [of themselves]?
Or did they create the heavens and earth? Rather, they are not certain in faith.
Or do they possess the treasures of your Lord, or do they have full control [of everything]?
Or do they have a stairway [to the heaven] by which they eavesdrop? Then let those who eavesdrop produce a compelling proof.
Or does He have daughters while you have sons?
Or are you asking them [O Prophet] for a reward so they find it too burdensome?
Or do they have [knowledge of] the unseen so they are writing it down?
Or do they intend a plot [against the Prophet]? But the plot of the disbelievers will rebound against themselves.
Or do they have a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah far above what they associate with Him.
If they were to see pieces of the sky falling down, they would still say, “[This is only] a mass of clouds.”
So leave them alone until they encounter their Day in which they will be struck down,
the Day their plots will not avail them in the least, nor will they be helped.
And for the wrongdoers, there will be another punishment before that, but most of them do not know.
Be patient [O Prophet] with your Lord’s decree, for indeed you are under Our [watchful] Eyes. And glorify the praises of your Lord when you rise.
And glorify Him at night and when the stars fade away.
