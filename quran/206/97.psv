Indeed, We sent this [Qur’an] down in the Night of Decree.
How do you know what the Night of Decree is?
The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months.
On that night the angels and the Spirit [Gabriel] descend by their Lord’s permission with all decrees.
It is all peace until the break of dawn.
