Alif Lām Mīm.
Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they will be left without being put to the test?
We certainly tested those who came before them. For Allah will surely make known those who are truthful and those who are liars.
Do the evildoers think that they can escape Us? How evil is their judgment!
Whoever hopes to meet Allah, the time appointed by Allah is sure to come, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Whoever strives, he only strives for his own good. Indeed, Allah is in no need of the worlds.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will surely expiate their sins, and reward them according to the best of what they used to do.
We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. But if they strive to make you associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them. To Me is your return; then I will inform you of what you used to do.
Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will surely admit them among the righteous.
There are some among people who say, “We believe in Allah”, but when they suffer for the sake of Allah, they deem the persecution of men as equal to the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they will surely say, “We were with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all people?
Allah will certainly make known those who truly believe and those who are hypocrites.
Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Follow our way, and we will bear the burden of your sins.” But they will never bear any of their sins. They are indeed liars.
They will certainly bear their own burdens, as well as other burdens along with their own burdens, and on the Day of Resurrection they will certainly be questioned concerning what they used to fabricate.
We sent Noah to his people, and he lived among them for a thousand years, less fifty. Then the Flood overtook them, while they persisted in wrongdoing.
But We saved him and those who were in the Ark, and We made it a sign for all people.
And [remember] Abraham, when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and fear Him; that is better for you, if only you knew.
You worship nothing besides Allah but idols and fabricate lies. Those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to give you provision. So seek provision from Allah, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will all be returned.
If you reject [the message], so did many nations reject before you. The duty of the Messenger is only to deliver the message clearly.”
Do they not see how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah.
Say, “Travel through the land and see how He originated the creation, then Allah will repeat it a second time. Indeed, Allah is Most Capable of all things.”
He punishes whom He wills and shows mercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will all be returned.
You cannot escape [His punishment] on earth or in the heaven, and you have no protector or helper besides Allah.”
Those who disbelieve in Allah’s signs and the meeting with Him, it is they who will have no hope in My mercy, and for them there will be a painful punishment.
His people’s only response was to say, “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe.
He said, “You have taken idols other than Allah as a means of love among yourselves in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection you will disown and curse one another. Your abode will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.”
Lot believed in him, and Abraham said, “I am emigrating to my Lord. He is indeed the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”
We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and assigned prophethood and scripture to his offspring, and gave him his reward in this life, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous.
And [remember] Lot, when he said to his people, “You surely commit a shameful act that no one in the world has ever done before you.
Do you approach men with lust, engage in highway robbery, and practice immoral acts in your gatherings?” But the only response his people gave was to say, “Bring us Allah’s punishment, if you are truthful.”
He said, “My Lord, help me against people who spread corruption.”
When Our angel-messengers came to Abraham with glad tidings, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town, for its people have been persisting in wickedness.”
He said, “But Lot is there!” They said, “We know well who is there. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife; she is one of those who will remain behind.”
When Our angel-messengers came to Lot, he was distressed by their coming and felt troubled on their account, but they said, “Do not fear nor grieve; we will surely save you and your family, except your wife; she is one of those who will remain behind.”
We will surely send down on the people of this town a scourge from the heaven because of their evildoing.”
We surely left some of its ruins as a clear sign for people of understanding.
To the people of Midian we sent their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah and expect the Last Day, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”
But they rejected him, so an earthquake seized them and they fell lifeless in their homes.
And [We destroyed] ‘Ād and Thamūd, which is clear to you from their ruined dwellings. Satan made their deeds appealing to them and averted them from the right way, although they were a people of perception.
And [We also destroyed] Korah, Pharaoh and Hāmān. Moses came to them with clear signs, but they showed arrogance in the land, yet they could not escape [Us].
Each of them We seized for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones; some were seized by a blast; some We caused the earth to swallow; and some We drowned. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.
The likeness of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a house. Indeed, the flimsiest of houses is the house of a spider, if only they knew.
Allah knows whatever they call upon besides Him. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Such are the comparisons We set forth for people, but none will understand them except the people of knowledge.
Allah created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. Indeed, there is a sign in this for the believers.
Recite [O Prophet] what is revealed to you of the Book, and establish prayer, for indeed prayer restrains one from immoral acts and wickedness. Indeed, the remembrance of Allah is of greater merit. And Allah knows all what you do.
Do not argue with the People of the Book except in the best manner, unless with those of them who transgress [against you]. And say, “We believe in what is sent down to us and what was sent down to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit.”
Thus We have sent down to you the Book. Those to whom We gave the Scripture believe in it, and from these [pagans] there are some who believe in it, and none rejects Our verses except the disbelievers.
You [O Prophet] never recited any book before this, nor did you write with your hand. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have raised suspicions.
Rather, this [Qur’an] is clear verses [preserved] in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge. And none rejects Our verses except the wrongdoers.
They say, “Why is it that no signs have been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.”
Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is being recited to them? Indeed, there is a mercy and reminder in it for people who believe.
Say, “Allah is Sufficient as a Witness between me and you. He knows all that is in the heavens and earth. Those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in Allah, it is they who are the losers.”
They ask you [O Prophet] to hasten the punishment. If it had not been for a time already set, the punishment would have come to them. But it will surely come to them by surprise when they least expect it.
They ask you to hasten the punishment, but Hell will surely encompass the disbelievers
on the Day when the punishment will overwhelm them from above and from below their feet, and He will say, “Taste [the punishment] for what you used to do!”
O My believing slaves, My earth is spacious, so worship Me alone.
Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will all be returned.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will surely accommodate them in mansions of Paradise under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of those who work [righteousness]! –
those who endure patiently and put their trust in their Lord.
How many creatures there are that cannot carry their provisions! It is Allah Who provides for them and for you, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
If you ask them who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and moon, they will surely say, “Allah.” How are they then deluded?
Allah extends provision to whom He wills of His slaves or restricts it. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
If you ask them who sends down rain from the sky, then revives therewith the land after its death, they will surely say, “Allah”. Say, “All praise is for Allah,” but most of them do not understand.
The life of this world is nothing but amusement and play, and the Abode of the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew.
When they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, devoting their faith sincerely to Him. But as soon as He rescues them to the land, they associate partners with Him,
showing their ingratitude to what We have given them and enjoy themselves, but they will soon come to know.
Do they not see that We have made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people around them are being snatched away? Do they still believe in falsehood and show ingratitude to Allah’s favors?
Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not a home in Hell for the disbelievers?
As for those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our ways, for Allah is certainly with those who do good.
