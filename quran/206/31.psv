Alif Lām Mīm.
These are the verses of the Book of wisdom,
a guidance and mercy for those who do good,
those who establish prayer and give zakah, and firmly believe in the Hereafter.
It is they who are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is they who are successful.
There are some among people who engage in a discourse of amusements in order to lead people away from the way of Allah without knowledge, and to make mockery of it. For such there will be a humiliating punishment.
When Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in arrogance, as if he did not hear them, as if there were deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful punishment.
But those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will have Gardens of Bliss,
abiding therein forever; this is a true promise from Allah, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
He created the heavens without pillars that you can see; and He placed firm mountains on the earth so it does not shake with you; and He spread therein all kinds of creatures. We sent down rain from the sky and caused to grow therein all kinds of fine plants.
This is Allah’s creation. So show Me what others beside Him have created. In fact, the wrongdoers are clearly misguided.
Indeed, We endowed Luqmān with wisdom, [saying], “Be grateful to Allah.” Whoever is grateful, it is only for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, then Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.
When Luqmān said to his son, while advising him, “O my dear son, do not associate partners with Allah. Indeed, associating partners with Allah is the worst wrongdoing.”
We have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning took place within two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents. To Me is the final return.
But if they strive to make you associate partners with Me of what you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. Yet keep company with them in this world with kindness, and follow the way of those who turn to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me is your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do.
[Luqmān said], “O my dear son, even if a deed were the weight of a mustard seed – whether in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth – Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.
“O my dear son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and be patient with whatever befalls you. This is a matter of firm resolve.
Do not turn your face away from people [in contempt], and do not walk on earth in arrogance. Indeed, Allah does not like anyone who is arrogant and boastful.
Be moderate in your gait and lower your voice. Indeed, the most repugnant of voices is the voice of donkeys.”
Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you all that is in the heavens and on earth, and has abundantly bestowed upon you His favors, both apparent and hidden? Yet there are some people who dispute concerning Allah without knowledge, or guidance, or an enlightening scripture.
When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “No, we follow what we found our forefathers doing.” Is that so, even if Satan is calling them to the punishment of the Blazing Fire?
Whoever submits himself to Allah and does good, he has certainly grasped the firmest handhold. To Allah is the ultimate decision of all matters.
But whoever disbelieves, do not let his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, then We will inform them of what they used to do. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.
We let them enjoy for a little while, then We will drive them to a harsh punishment.
If you ask them who created the heavens and earth, they will surely say, “Allah.” Say, “All praise is for Allah.” Yet most of them do not understand.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. Indeed, Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.
If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean [were ink], replenished by seven more oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Indeed, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
Your creation and resurrection is only like that of a single soul. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All Seeing.
Do you not see that Allah causes the night to merge into day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term, and that Allah is All-Aware of what you do?
That is because Allah is the Truth, and what they supplicate other than Him is false, and it is Allah Who is the Most High, the All-Great.
Do you not see that the ships sail through the sea by the grace of Allah, so that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and grateful.
When they are overwhelmed by waves like canopies, they cry out to Allah in sincere devotion to Him alone, but when He delivers them to the land, only some of them take a middle course [in faith]. But none rejects Our signs except every ungrateful treacherous.
O mankind, fear your Lord and dread a day when no father will avail his son, nor will a son avail his father anything. The promise of Allah is true, so do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver [Satan] deceive you concerning Allah.
Indeed, Allah has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows what it will do tomorrow, nor does any soul know in which land it will die. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.
