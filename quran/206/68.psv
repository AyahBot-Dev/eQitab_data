Nūn. By the pen and what they write,
By the grace of your Lord [O Prophet], you are not madman.
You will surely have a never-ending reward.
Indeed, you are of a great moral character.
Soon you will see and they will see,
which of you is afflicted with madness.
Indeed, your Lord alone knows best who has strayed from His way and those who are rightly guided.
So do not obey the deniers.
They wish that you would compromise so they would too compromise.
And do not obey every disgraceful swearer,
backbiter, gossip-monger,
withholder of good, transgressor, sinful,
coarse, and furthermore, an illegitimate child.
Simply because he has wealth and children,
When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables!”
We will soon brand him on the snout.
Indeed, We have tested them [the Makkans] as We tested the people of the garden, when they swore to harvest its fruits in the early morning,
and made no exception [by saying: if Allah wills].
Then it was struck by an affliction from your Lord while they were asleep,
and it turned to ashes as black as night.
Then in the early morning they called out to one another:
“Go early to your garden if you really wish to harvest.”
So they set out, whispering to one another,
“Not a single poor person should enter your garden today.”
And they left early, fully determined to stick to their plan.
But when they saw the garden, they said, “We must have lost our way!
Rather, we have been deprived.”
The best among them said, “Did I not say to you to glorify Allah?”
They said, “Glory be to our Lord! We were truly wrongdoers.”
Then they turned to one another, throwing blame.
They said, “Woe to us! We were surely transgressors.
Our Lord may give us something better than this. We certainly turn to our Lord in hope.”
Such is the punishment [in this world]; but the punishment of the Hereafter is far worse, if only they knew.
Indeed, the righteous will have gardens of bliss with their Lord.
Should We then treat Muslims like the wicked?
What is the matter with you that you make such a judgment?
Or do you have a scripture in which you read
that you will be given whatever you choose?
Or do you have a solemn promise binding upon Us until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you decide for yourselves?
Ask them which of them can guarantee that.
Or do they have associate-gods? Then let them bring forth their associate-gods, if they are truthful.
On the Day when the Shin [of Allah] will be uncovered, and they are invited to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so.
Their eyes will be downcast, overwhelmed with humiliation, for they were invited to prostrate when they were capable [but they refused].
So leave to Me those who reject this message [O Prophet]. We will gradually lead them to their ruin in ways that they do not perceive.
I will give them respite, but My plan is firm.
Or are you asking them for a reward, so they find it too burdensome?
Or do they have knowledge of the unseen, so they write it down?
So be patient with the decree of your Lord, and do not be like [Jonah], the man of the Whale, when he cried out in anguish.
Had it not been for the grace that he received from his Lord, he would have surely been thrown at the barren shore, blameworthy.
But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous.
The disbelievers would almost strike you down with their malicious gazes when they hear the Reminder, and they say, “He is certainly mad.”
But it is nothing other than a reminder to the whole world.
