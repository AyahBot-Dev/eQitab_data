Alif Lām Ra. This is a Book whose verses are perfected, then fully explained, from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware.
[Say O Prophet], “Worship none except Allah. Indeed, I am sent to you from Him, as a warner and bearer of glad tidings.
And seek your Lord’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance, He will grant you good enjoyment of life for an appointed term and graciously reward the doers of good. But if you turn away, I truly fear for you the punishment of a great Day.
To Allah is your return, and He is Most Capable of all things.”
Indeed, they lean forward to conceal their feelings from Him, but even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal, for He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.
There is no moving creature on earth but upon Allah is its provision. He knows its place of dwelling and its place of rest; everything is [written] in a clear Record.
It is He Who created the heavens and earth in six Days – and His Throne was upon the water – so that He may test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say to them, “You will certainly be raised after death,” the disbelievers will surely say, “This is nothing but clear magic!”
If We delay their punishment for a limited time, they will surely say, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, the day when it comes upon them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be encompassed by what they used to ridicule.
If We give man a taste of Our mercy, then take it away from him, he becomes utterly despaired and ungrateful.
But if We give him a taste of prosperity after being afflicted with hardship, he will surely say, “All my ills are gone,” and becomes exultant and boastful,
except those who are patient and do righteous deeds; it is they who will have forgiveness and a great reward.
Perhaps you may disregard some of what is revealed to you [O Prophet], and may feel distressed because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down to him, or why has not an angel come with him?” You are only a warner, and Allah is in charge of all things.
Or do they say, “He has fabricated it”? Say, “Then produce ten fabricated Chapters like it and seek help from whoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!”
But if they do not respond to you, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that none has the right to be worshiped except Him. Will you then submit to Him [as Muslims]?
Those who seek the life of this world and its splendor, We will repay them in full in this life for their deeds, and nothing will be diminished from them therein.
It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire. All their efforts will be worthless, and all their deeds will be futile.
Can they be like those who are upon clear proof from their Lord, backed by a witness [Gabriel] from Him, and before it was the Book of Moses a guide and mercy? Such people believe in it. But whoever of the factions disbelieves in it, the Fire will be their promised end. So have no doubt about it, for it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe.
Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah? Such people will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord.” Indeed, Allah’s curse is upon the wrongdoers,
those who hinder [people] from the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, and they disbelieve in the Hereafter.”
They will have no escape on earth, nor will they have any protector besides Allah. Their punishment will be doubled, for they failed to hear or see [the truth].
It is they who destroyed themselves, and all what they fabricated will be lost from them.
There is no doubt that they will be the worst losers in the Hereafter.
Those who believe, do righteous deeds and humble themselves before their Lord, it is they who are the people of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.
The similitude of the two parties is that of the blind and deaf, compared to the seeing and hearing. Are they equal? Will you not then take heed?
We sent Noah to his people [and he said], “I am indeed a clear warner to you,
that you worship none except Allah. I truly fear for you the punishment of a painful Day.”
But the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said, “We only see you a human being like ourselves, and we do not see those who follow you except the lowest among us apparently. We do not see you superior to us, rather, we think that you are liars.”
He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, but you fail to see it. Can we force you to accept it despite your aversion to it?
O my people, I do not ask you for any wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah. I will not dismiss those who believe; they will surely meet their Lord, but I see that you are ignorant people.
O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I were to dismiss them? Will you not then take heed?
I do not tell you that I have Allah’s treasures or that I know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom you look down upon, that Allah will never grant them any good, for Allah knows best what is in their hearts. If I did so, I would surely be one of the wrongdoers.”
They said, “O Noah, you have argued far too much with us, so bring what you are threatening us with, if you are one of the truthful.”
He said, “It is only Allah Who can bring it upon you if He wills, then you will have no escape.
Nor will my advice benefit you – no matter how hard I try – if Allah wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.”
Or do they say that he has fabricated it”? Say [O Prophet], “If I did fabricate it, then I am responsible for my sin, but I am innocent of the sins you commit.”
It was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will ever believe except those who have already believed. So do not grieve over what they do.
Construct the Ark under Our [watchful] Eyes and Our direction, and do not plead with Me for those who did wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”
So he started constructing the Ark, and every time some chiefs of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, “If you ridicule us now, we will soon ridicule you as you are ridiculing us.
You will come to know who will be afflicted with a disgracing punishment, and upon whom will descend an everlasting punishment.”
When Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, “Take on board a pair from every species and your family – except those who have already been decreed [to drown] – and those who believe.” But none believed with him except a few.
Noah said, “Board it; in the name of Allah it sails and anchors. My Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
As it sailed with them through waves like mountains, Noah called out to his son, who had kept himself apart, “O my son, come aboard with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.”
He said, “I will take shelter on a mountain which will save me from the water.” Noah said, “Today no one will be saved from Allah’s punishment except those on whom He may have mercy.” Thereupon the waves came between them, and he was among those who were drowned.
And it was said, “O earth, swallow up your water. O sky, withhold [your rain]!” The water subsided and the command was fulfilled, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi, and it was said, “Away with the wrongdoing people!”
Noah called out to his Lord, saying, “My Lord, my son is one of my family, and Your promise is true and You are the Most Just of all judges!”
Allah said, “O Noah, he is not of your family, for he was not righteous in his conduct. So do not ask Me of what you have no knowledge. I admonish you, so you do not be among the ignorants.”
Noah said, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.”
It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace from Us, and with blessings upon you and upon some nations [descending] from those who are with you. As for other nations, We will grant them enjoyment for a while, then they will be afflicted with a painful punishment from Us.”
This is one of the stories of the unseen that we reveal to you [O Prophet]; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient; the outcome is for the righteous.
To the people of ‘Ād We sent their brother Hūd. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. You are but fabricators.
O my people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward is only with the One Who created me. Do you not then understand?
O my people, seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance; He will send down upon you abundant rain from the sky, and will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away in wickedness.”
They said, “O Hūd, you have not brought us any clear evidence, and we will not forsake our gods on account of what you say, nor will we believe in you.
All we can say that some of our gods have afflicted you with madness.” He said, “I take Allah as witness, and you too be witnesses, that I disown whatever you associate
with Him. So plot against me all together, then give me no respite.
I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no moving creature but He holds it by its forelock. My Lord is on a straight path.
But if you turn away, I have conveyed to you what I have been sent with. My Lord will replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him in the least. My Lord watches over all things.”
When Our command came, We saved Hūd and those who believed with him by Our mercy, and We saved them from a harsh punishment.
Such were the people of ‘Ād, who denied the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His Messengers and followed the command of every obstinate oppressor.
They were overtaken by a curse in this world and again on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, ‘Ād denied their Lord; so away with ‘Ād, the people of Hūd!
To the people of Thamūd, We sent their brother Sālih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god except Him. It is He Who brought you into being from the earth and settled you therein. So seek His forgiveness then turn to Him in repentance, for My Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive.”
They said, “O Sālih, we truly had hopes in you before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers used to worship? We are in disturbing doubt about what you are calling us to.”
He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, who could protect me from Allah, if I were to disobey Him? You would only increase me in loss.
O my people, this she-camel of Allah is a sign to you; so leave her graze in Allah’s land, and do not touch her with harm, or else an imminent punishment will overtake you.”
But they hamstrung her, so he said, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is an unfailing promise!”
So when Our command came, We saved Sālih and those who believed with him, by Our mercy, and from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty.
The huge blast seized those who did wrong, and they fell dead in their homes,
as though they had never lived there. Indeed, Thamūd denied their Lord; so away with Thamūd!
Our angel-messengers came to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace.” And in a short while he brought a roasted calf.
When he saw their hands not reaching the food, he became suspicious and felt scared of them. They said, “Do not be scared. We have been sent to the people of Lot.”
His wife was standing by, and laughed after We gave her glad tidings of [the birth of] Isaac and Jacob after Isaac.
She said, “Alas for me! How can I bear a child while I am an old woman, and this is my husband, an old man? This is a strange thing indeed!”
They said, “Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O people of the house. He is Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.”
When shock of fear left Abraham and the glad tidings [of Isaac’s birth] came to him, he started pleading with Us concerning the people of Lot.
Abraham was indeed forbearing, tenderhearted, and constantly returning in repentance.
[The angels said], “O Abraham, leave this, for indeed the command of your Lord has already come to pass, and there will come upon them a punishment that cannot be averted.”
When Our angel-messengers came to Lot, he was perturbed and felt troubled on their account, and said, “This is a distressing day.”
His people came rushing to him, and they were accustomed to committing evil deeds. He said, “O my people, here are my daughters [for marriage]; they are purer for you. So fear Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not a right-minded man among you?”
They said, “You already know that we have no need for your daughters, and you surely know what we want!”
He said, “Would that I had some strength [to stop you] or could rely on a mighty support!”
[The angels said], “O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord; they can never reach you. So set out with your family in the dark part of night, and none of you should look back, except your wife; she will suffer the same fate as the others. Their appointed time is the morning; is not the morning near?”
When Our command came, We turned their cities upside down and rained down upon them clustered stones of baked clay,
marked by your Lord; this is not far from the evildoers.
And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god besides Him. Do not give short measure or weight. I see that you are in prosperity, but I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing Day.
O my people, give full measure and weight with justice, and do not defraud people of their dues, nor go about spreading corruption on earth.
What remains from the provision of Allah is far better, if you are [true] believers; I am not a keeper over you.”
They said, “O Shu‘ayb, does your prayer command you that we should forsake what our forefathers worshiped, or that we should give up dealing with our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are such a forbearing and right-minded man!”
He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I should have a clear proof from my Lord, and He has given me good provision from Himself. I do not want to go against what I am forbidding you. I only want to put things right to the best of my ability. My success only comes through Allah; in Him I put my trust and to Him I turn.
O my people, do not let your opposition to me cause you to suffer a punishment similar to that of the people of Noah, the people of Hūd or the people of Sālih. And the people of Lot are not far away from you.
Seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. Indeed, My Lord is Most Merciful, Most Affectionate.”
They said, “O Shu‘ayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and we surely see you weak among us. Were it not for your clan, we would have surely stoned you, for you have no standing among us.”
He said, “O my people, does my clan have a higher status to you than Allah? And you have abandoned Him behind your backs. Indeed, my Lord encompasses all what you do.
O my people, do whatever you can; I will do mine. You will come to know who will receive a disgracing punishment, and who is a liar. Wait; I too am waiting with you.”
When Our command came, We saved Shu‘ayb and those who believed with him by Our mercy. But the huge blast seized the wrongdoers, so they fell dead in their homes,
as if they had never dwelt there. Behold, away with Midian just as it was with Thamūd!
And We sent Moses with Our signs and compelling proof
to Pharaoh and his courtiers, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, even though the command of Pharaoh was misguided.
He will be at the forefront of his people on the Day of Resurrection, leading them into the Fire. What a terrible place to be led to!
They were pursued by a curse in this world as well as on the Day of Resurrection. What a terrible gift to receive!
These are some of the stories of the towns that We relate to you; some are still standing, while others have been mowed down.
We did not wrong them, rather they wronged themselves. Their gods whom they supplicated besides Allah were of no avail to them in the least when the command of your Lord came, and they only added to their destruction.
Such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns that are given to wrongdoing; His seizing is surely painful and severe.
Indeed, there is a sign in this for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which people will be gathered and a Day that will be witnessed.
We only delay it until a fixed term.
When that Day comes, no one will speak except by His permission. Some among them will be wretched and others blissful.
As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, wherein they will be moaning and gasping,
they will abide therein for as long as the heavens and earth exist, except what your Lord wills; your Lord does what He wills.
As for those who are destined for bliss, they will be in Paradise abiding therein as long as the heavens and earth exist, except what your Lord wills – an unceasing gift.
Have no doubt about what they worship; they only worship what their forefathers worshiped. We will surely give them their full share undiminished.
We gave Moses the Scripture, but dispute arose about it. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them. They are indeed in a disquieting doubt about it.
Your Lord will surely pay everyone in full for their deeds, for He is All-Aware of what they do.
So stay on a straight path as you have been commanded, along with those who repented with you, and do not cross the limits. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of what you do.
Do not incline to the wrongdoers, or else the Fire will seize you. Then you will have no protectors besides Allah, nor will you be helped.
Establish prayer at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Indeed, good deeds wipe out evil deeds. This is a reminder for those who are mindful.
And be patient, for indeed Allah does not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.
If only there had been among the generations before you righteous people who would forbid others from spreading corruption in the land, except a few of them whom We saved. But the wrongdoers pursued their luxury which they were given therein, and they were wicked.
Your Lord would never destroy the towns unjustly while their people were acting righteously.
If your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind a single community, but they will not cease to differ,
except those whom Allah has given mercy, and for this He created them, and the word of your Lord will be fulfilled: “I will certainly fill Hell with jinn and humans all together.”
We relate to you [O Prophet] the stories of the messengers to strengthen your heart. And there has come to you in this the truth, an admonition and a reminder to the believers.
Say to those who do not believe, “Carry on in your ways; so will we do.
And wait; we too are waiting.”
To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and earth, and to Him will return all matters. So worship Him and put your trust in Him, for your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
