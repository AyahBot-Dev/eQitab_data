When the sky is rent asunder,
and hearkens to its Lord, as it must,
and when the earth is leveled out,
and casts out all what it contains, and becomes empty,
and hearkens to its Lord, as it must,
O humans, you are toiling towards your Lord, and you will surely meet Him.
Whoever is given his Record in his right hand,
he will have an easy reckoning,
and he will return to his people joyfully.
But whoever is given his Record from behind his back,
he will call out for destruction,
and he will enter the Blazing Fire.
Indeed, he used to live among his people joyfully.
and he thought that he would never return [to Allah].
Indeed he will! His Lord was always watching him.
Indeed, I swear by the twilight,
and by the night and what it covers,
and by the moon when it becomes full,
You will surely pass from one stage to another.
Then what is the matter with them that they do not believe,
and when the Qurâ€™an is recited to them, they do not prostrate?
Rather, the disbelievers persist in denying it,
but Allah knows best whatever they harbor in their hearts.
So give them the tidings of a painful punishment.
But those who believe and do righteous deeds will have a never-ending reward.
