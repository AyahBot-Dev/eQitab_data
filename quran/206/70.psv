A challenger asked for a punishment bound to come
upon the disbelievers, which none can avert,
from Allah, Lord of the pathways of ascent,
by which the angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him on a Day the length of which is fifty thousand years.
So be patient [O Prophet] with beautiful patience.
Indeed, they see this [punishment] far off,
but We see it to be close at hand.
On the Day when the sky will be like molten brass
and the mountains will be like dyed wool,
and no close friend will ask about another,
even though they will see one another. The wicked will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by offering his children,
and his wife and his brother,
and his kindred who stood by him,
and everyone on earth, just to save himself.
By no means! It is a raging Flame,
that will strip off the scalps.
It will call everyone who turned their backs and disobeyed,
and amassed and hoarded wealth.
Indeed, man was created impatient:
when evil befalls him, he bewails,
but when good fortune comes his way, he becomes tight-fisted –
except those who pray,
who are steadfast in their prayers;
and who give a due share of their wealth
to the beggar and the dispossessed;
and who firmly believe in the Day of Judgment;
and those who fear the punishment of their Lord –
for none can feel secure from their Lord’s punishment –
and those who guard their private parts,
except from their wives or bondwomen whom they own, for then they are not to be blamed.
But whoever seeks beyond that, it is they who are the transgressors.
and those who fulfill their trusts and pledges;
and who are upright in their testimonies;
and who take due care of their prayers;
they will be honored in gardens.
What is the matter with the disbelievers that they are rushing towards you [O Prophet],
from the right and from the left, in crowds?
Does everyone of them aspire to enter a garden of bliss?
By no means! We have created them from what they know.
I swear by the Lord of the sunrises and sunsets that We are surely Capable
to replace them with others better than them, and none can escape Our decree.
So leave them to engage in their falsehood and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised;
the Day when they will rush out of their graves as if they are racing towards a goal,
with their eyes downcast and overwhelmed with disgrace. That is the Day that they were promised.
