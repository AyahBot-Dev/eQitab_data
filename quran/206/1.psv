In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.
All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds,
the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful,
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.
Guide us to the straight path,
the path of those whom You have blessed; not of those who incurred Your Wrath, or of those who went astray.
