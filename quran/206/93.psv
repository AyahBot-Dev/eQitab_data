By the morning brightness,
and by the night when it is still,
your Lord has not forsaken you [O Prophet], nor does He hate you;
the Hereafter is better for you than the present life;
and your Lord will certainly give you so much that you will be well pleased.
Did He not find you an orphan then take good care of you?
Did He not find you unguided then guide you?
Did He not find you in need then enrich you?
So do not mistreat the orphan,
nor repulse the beggar;
and proclaim the blessings of your Lord.
