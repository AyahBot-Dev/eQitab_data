Read in the name of your Lord Who created,
created man from a clinging clot.
Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous,
Who taught by the pen,
taught man what he did not know.
Indeed, man transgresses
when he deems himself to be self-sufficient.
Indeed, to your Lord is the return.
Have you seen the one who prevents
a slave [of Allah] from praying?
What if this [slave] is rightly guided,
and enjoins righteousness?
How about the one who denies and turns away?
Does he not know that Allah is watching all?
No indeed; if he does not desist, We will surely drag him by the forelock â€“
a lying, sinful forelock.
So let him call his associates;
We will call the wardens of Hellfire.
No indeed; do not obey him, but prostrate and draw near [to Allah].
