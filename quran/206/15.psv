Alif Lām Ra. These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur’an.
There will come a time that the disbelievers will wish that they were Muslims.
Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted with false hope; they will come to know.
We never destroyed any town except that it had a destined time.
No nation can advance its appointed time, nor can they delay it.
They say, “O you to whom the Reminder has been sent down, You are surely insane!
Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are truthful?”
We do not send down the angels except for a just cause, and then they [the disbelievers] would be granted no respite.
It is We Who have sent down the Reminder, and it is We Who will preserve it.
We did send messengers before you among the factions of early peoples.
No messenger came to them except that they ridiculed him.
This is how We let this [denial] enter the hearts of the wicked.
They will not believe in it, although the examples of the earlier people is well established.
Even if We were to open for them a gateway to the heaven, through which they kept ascending,
they would still say, “Our eyes have been dazzled; rather, we have been bewitched.”
We have placed constellations in the heaven and adorned it for the onlookers,
and We have guarded it from every accursed devil,
except the one who manages to eavesdrop, he will then be pursued by a visible burning flame.
As for the earth, We have spread it out and placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein everything in due proportion.
And We have made therein for you means of sustenance and for those whom you do not provide.
There is nothing except that We have its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a determined measure.
And We send fertilizing winds, and send down rain from the sky for you to drink, and it is not you who could store it.
Indeed, it is We Who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritors [of all things].
We surely know those of you who have gone before and those who are yet to come.
It is your Lord Who will gather them together. He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
We have created man from sounding clay, made of aging mud.
And the jinn We created before that, from smokeless fire.
And [remember] when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from sounding clay, made of aging mud.
When I have shaped him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down before him in prostration.”
Thereupon, all of the angels fell down in prostration,
except Iblīs, who refused to be with those who prostrated.
Allah said, “O Iblīs, what is the matter with you that you were not with those who prostrated?”
He said, “I am not such to prostrate before a human whom You created from sounding clay, made of aging mud.”
He said, “Then get out of here, for you are accursed,
and the curse will be upon you until the Day of Judgment.”
Iblīs said, “My Lord, then grant me respite until the Day they are resurrected.”
Allah said, “You are of those who are granted respite,
until the Day of the Appointed Time.”
He said, “My Lord, since You have sent me astray, I will surely make [sins] alluring to them on earth and mislead them all,
except Your chosen slaves among them.”
Allah said, “This is a straight path leading to Me.
You will have no authority over My slaves, except the deviants who follow you.
And Hell is certainly the promised place for them, all together.
It has seven gates; each gate will have its allotted share of them.”
The righteous will be in gardens and springs.
“Enter in peace and safety!”
We will remove all ill feelings from their hearts; like brothers, seated on couches facing one another.
No fatigue will ever touch them therein, nor will they ever be made to leave.
Inform My slaves that I am indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful,
and that My punishment is the most painful punishment.
And inform them about the guests of Abraham.
When they entered upon him and said, “Peace!” He said, “We are afraid of you.”
They said, “Do not be afraid; We give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.”
He said, “Do you give me glad tidings despite my old age? What glad tidings are you giving me?”
They said, “We have given you glad tidings in truth, so do not be of those who despair.”
He said, “Who would despair of his Lord’s mercy except those who are misguided?”
He said, “So, what is your mission, O messengers?”
They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people,
except the household of Lot; we will surely save them all,
except his wife; We have decreed that she will be among those who stay behind.”
When the messengers came to the household of Lot,
he said, “You are an unfamiliar people.”
They said, “We have come to you with that [punishment] which they have doubted.
We have come to you with the truth, and we are certainly truthful.
So travel with your household in the dark of night and go behind them; none of you should look back, and keep going to where you are commanded.”
We conveyed this decree to him that these [people] will be exterminated by early morning.”
The people of the city came [to Lot] rejoicing.
Lot said, “These are my guests, so do not bring shame on me.
Fear Allah and do not disgrace me.”
They said, “Did we not forbid you from [protecting] people?”
He said, “These are my daughters [to marry] if you must.”
By your life [O prophet], they were wandering blindly in their intoxication [of lust].
So they were seized by the blast at sunrise,
and We turned their cities upside down and rained down on them stones of baked clay.
Indeed, there are signs in this for those who discern.
And their place is located by a known route.
Indeed, there are signs in this for the believers.
And the people of the Forest [Shu‘ayb] were wrongdoers.
So We punished them in retribution, and both [places] are by a clear highway.
Surely the people of Al-Hijr [Thamūd] also rejected the messengers.
We gave them Our signs, but they kept turning away from them.
They carved houses in the mountains, feeling secure.
So they were seized by the blast early in the morning.
Nothing of what they earned was of any avail to them.
We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them except for a true purpose. The Hour is certainly coming, so bear with them graciously.
Indeed, your Lord is the Absolute Creator, the All-Knowing.
We have surely given you the seven oft-repeated verses and the great Qur’an.
Do not look longingly at the pleasures We have given certain classes of them, nor grieve over them, but lower your wing [in humility] to the believers.
And say, “I am indeed a clear warner.” –
just as We sent down [punishment] upon those who divided [their religion],
those who split the Qur’an into different portions.
By your Lord, We will surely question them all
concerning what they used to do.
Then proclaim what you are commanded, and turn away from those who associate partners with Allah.
We will surely suffice you against the mockers,
those who set up besides Allah another god; they will come to know.
We know that you are distressed by what they say.
Glorify your Lord with praise and be among those who prostrate [to Him],
and worship your Lord until the certainty [of death] comes to you.
