By the dawn,
and the ten nights,
and the even and the odd,
and by the night when it comes,
are these oaths not sufficient for those who have sense?
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Ād
of Iram, who were people of great stature,
the like of whom had never been created in the land;
and Thamūd, who carved out the rocks in the Valley;
and the mighty and powerful Pharaoh?
All of them transgressed in the land,
and spread therein much corruption,
so your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.
Indeed, your Lord is ever vigilant.
As for man, when he is tested by his Lord by honoring him and bestowing blessings upon him, he says, “My Lord has [deservedly] honored me!”
But when he is tested by restricting his provision, he says, “My Lord has [undeservedly] humiliated me!”
No indeed! You are not kind to the orphan,
nor do you urge one another to feed the needy,
and you greedily consume the entire inheritance,
and love wealth immensely.
No indeed! When the earth is crushed over and over,
and your Lord comes with the angels, rank after rank,
and Hell is brought near on that Day – this is when man will understand, but what is the use of that understanding?
He will say, “Would that I had sent forth something for my [eternal] life!”
None can punish as He punishes on that Day,
and none can bind as He binds.
[It will be said to the believer,] “O the tranquil soul!
Return to your Lord, well pleased and pleasing [to Him].
Join My [righteous] slaves,
and enter My Paradise.”
