By the sun and its brightness,
and by the moon as it follows it,
and by the day as it displays it,
and by the night as it covers it,
and by the sky and He Who made it,
and by the earth and how He spread it,
and by the soul and how He fashioned it,
then inspired it [to know] its wickedness and righteousness,
Indeed, he who purifies his soul will attain success,
and he who corrupts it will be doomed.
Thamūd rejected [the messenger] because of their transgression,
when the most wretched among them rose [to kill the camel].
Although the messenger of Allah warned them, “Hands off the she-camel of Allah and her drink!”
Yet they rejected him and hamstrung her. So their Lord destroyed them for their sin and leveled them to the ground.
And He has no fear of the consequences thereof.
