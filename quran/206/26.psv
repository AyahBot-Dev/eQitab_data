These are the verses of the clear Book.
Perhaps you will grieve yourself to death because they do not believe.
If We willed, We could send down upon them a sign from the heaven, at which their necks would stay bowed in humility.
No new reminder comes to them from the Most Compassionate except that they turn away from it.
They have rejected [the Truth], soon there will come to them the consequences of their ridicule.
Do they not see the earth, how many fine kinds of plants We grow in it?
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them will not believe.
Your Lord is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
And [remember] when your Lord called out to Moses, “Go to the wrongdoing people –
the people of Pharaoh; will they not fear [the punishment of] Allah?”
He said, “My Lord, I fear that they may reject me,
and I will feel distressed and my tongue will not be fluent, so send Aaron along [to help me].
Moreover, they have a charge against me, so I fear they may kill me.”
Allah said, “Certainly not! Go, both of you, with Our signs; We are with you, listening.
Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are the messengers from the Lord of the worlds,
that you let the Children of Israel go with us.’”
Pharaoh said, “Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you stayed with us several years of your life?
Yet you did what you did, and you are extremely ungrateful.”
He said, “I did it when I had no guidance.
So I fled from you in fear. Then my Lord gave me wisdom and made me one of the messengers.
Is this a favor that you remind me with, that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?
Pharaoh said, “What is ‘the Lord of the worlds’?”
Moses said, “The Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, if only you had sure faith.”
Pharaoh said to those around him, “Did you hear [what he just said]?”
Moses said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.”
Pharaoh said, “Your messenger who has been sent to you is truly insane!”
Moses said, “Lord of the east and west and all that is between them, if only you had sense!”
Pharaoh said, “If you take any god other than me, I will throw you into prison.”
Moses said, “What if I bring you a clear proof?”
Pharaoh said, “Bring it then, if you are truthful!”
So he threw down his staff, and suddenly it was a real serpent.
And he drew out his hand, and it was glowing white to the beholders.
Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, “This is indeed a learned magician!
He wants to drive you out of your land with his magic. What do you suggest?”
They said, “Let him and his brother wait and dispatch heralds to the cities
to bring you every learned magician.”
So the magician were assembled at an appointed time on a known day.
And it was said to the people, “Will you join the gathering,
so that we may follow the magicians if they are victorious?”
When the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, “Will there be a reward for us if we are victorious?”
He said, “Yes, and then you will surely be of those who are close to me.”
Moses said to them, “Throw whatever you wish to throw.”
So they threw their ropes and staffs, and said, “By the glory of Pharaoh, it is we who will be the victorious!”
Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it swallowed up all objects of their illusion.
So the magicians fell down in prostration.
They said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
Pharaoh said, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission. Indeed, he is your master who taught you magic, but you will soon come to know. I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then I will crucify you all.”
They said, “No harm; we will surely return to our Lord.
We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first of the believers.”
We inspired Moses, “Leave with My slaves by night; you will surely be pursued.”
So Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities,
saying, “These are but a small band,
and they have enraged us,
but we are all well-prepared.”
Thus did We drive them out of their gardens and springs,
and their treasures and splendid dwellings.
So it was; and We made the Children of Israel to inherit them.
They pursued them at sunrise.
When the two groups saw each other, the companions of Moses said, “We are surely overtaken!”
Moses said, “Certainly not! My Lord is with me; He will guide me.”
Then We inspired Moses, “Strike the sea with your staff,” so it parted, each part became like a huge mountain.
Then We brought the others [pursuers] close to that place,
and We saved Moses and all those who were with him,
then We drowned the others.
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Indeed, your Lord is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
Relate to them the story of Abraham,
when he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship?”
They said, “We worship idols and remain devoted to them.”
He said, “Do they hear you when you call upon them?
Or can they benefit or harm you?”
They said, “No, but this is what we found our forefathers doing.”
He said, “Do you see what you have been worshiping,
you and your ancestors?
Indeed, they are my enemies, except the Lord of the worlds,
Who created me, so He guides me;
and it is He Who provides me with food and drink;
and when I am ill He heals me;
and He will cause me to die then bring me back to life;
and I hope that He will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgment.”
“My Lord, grant me knowledge, and join me with the righteous,
and grant me an honorable mention among the later generations,
and make me of those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss;
and forgive my father, for he is one of those who have gone astray;
and do not disgrace me on the Day when all will be resurrected –
the Day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail,
except the one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.”
Paradise will be brought near to the righteous,
and Hellfire will be uncovered to those who went astray,
and they will be told, “Where are those whom you used to worship
other than Allah? Can they help you or even help themselves?”
Then they will be hurled into Hell one upon another, along with those who led them astray,
and the followers of Iblīs, all together.
There the deviants will say while quarreling with their false deities,
“By Allah, we were clearly misguided,
when we deemed you equal to the Lord of the worlds.
None led us astray except the wicked.
Now we neither have any intercessors,
nor a close friend.
If only we had a chance to return, we would be among the believers.”
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Your Lord is surely the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Noah rejected the messengers
when their brother Noah said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
so fear Allah, and obey me.
I seek of you no reward for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;
so fear Allah, and obey me.”
They said, “Shall we believe in you when you are followed by the lowest people?”
He said, “What knowledge do I have of what they do?
Their reckoning is only with my Lord, if you realize!
I am not going to drive the believers away.
I am only a clear warner.”
They said, “O Noah, if you do not desist, you will certainly be stoned.”
He said, “My Lord, my people have rejected me.
So judge between me and them decisively, and save me and the believers who are with me.”
So We saved him and those who were with him in the fully laden Ark.
Then We drowned thereafter all the rest.
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Indeed, your Lord is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of ‘Ād rejected the messengers
when their brother Hūd said to them, “Will you not fear Allah?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
so fear Allah, and obey me.
I do not ask you for any reward for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
Do you build a landmark on every high place for no purpose?
And do you construct for yourselves palaces, hoping that you will live forever?
And when you attack [others], do you attack ruthlessly?
So fear Allah, and obey me.
And fear the One Who has provided you with everything you know:
Who provided you with livestock and children,
and with gardens and springs.
I fear for you the punishment of a momentous day.”
They said, “It is the same to us whether you admonish us or not.
This is nothing but the custom of the former people,
and we will never be punished.”
Thus they rejected him, so We destroyed them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe,
Your Lord is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Thamūd rejected the messengers
when their brother Sālih said to them, “Will you not fear Allah?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
so fear Allah, and obey me.
I do not ask you for any reward for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
Will you be left secure in whatever you have here,
in gardens and springs,
and in fields of crops and date-palms laden with tender fruit,
carving out houses in the mountains with great skill?
So fear Allah, and obey me.
And do not obey the command of the transgressors,
those who spread corruption in the land and never do what is right.”
They said, “You are but one of those who are bewitched!
You are but a human like us, so bring a sign if you are one of the truthful.”
Sālih said, “This is a she-camel; she will have her share of water and you will have yours, each on a specified day.
Do not touch her with harm, or you will be seized by the punishment of a horrible day.”
But they hamstrung her, then they became regretful,
So the punishment seized them. Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Your Lord is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Lot rejected the messengers,
when their brother Lot said to them, “Will you not fear Allah?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
so fear Allah, and obey me.
I do not ask you for any reward for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
Do you approach males with lust among all people,
leaving the wives whom your Lord has created for you? You are but a transgressing people.”
They said, “O Lot, If you do not desist, you will surely be expelled.”
Lot said, “I utterly abhor your practice.
My Lord, save me and my family from [the consequences of] what they do.”
So We saved him and all his family,
except an old woman who was among those who remained behind.
Then We destroyed the rest,
and We poured down upon them a rain [of stones]. How terrible was the rain of those who were warned!
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Your Lord is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of the Forest rejected the messengers.
When Shu‘ayb said to them, “Will you not fear Allah?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
so fear Allah, and obey me.
I do not ask you for any reward for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds.
Give full measure and do not be of those who defraud others,
and weigh with accurate scales,
and do not defraud people of their goods, nor go about in the land spreading corruption.
And fear the One Who created you and the former peoples.”
They said, “You are truly bewitched!
You are only a human being like us, and we think you are nothing but a liar.
So cause pieces of the sky to fall upon us, if you are of the truthful.”
Shu‘ayb said, “My Lord knows best whatever you do.”
Thus they rejected him, so they were seized by the punishment of the cloudy day; it was the punishment of a horrible day.
Indeed, there is a sign in this, yet most of them would not believe.
Your Lord is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
This is indeed a revelation from the Lord of the worlds,
which the Trustworthy Spirit [Gabriel] has brought down
to your heart [O Prophet] so that you may be one of the warners,
in clear Arabic language.
And it was indeed [mentioned] in the scriptures of the former peoples.
Was it not a proof for them that the learned men of the Children of Israel recognized it [to be true]?
If We had sent it down to any of the non-Arabs,
and he had recited it to them, still they would not have believed in it.
This is how We made it [disbelief] enter the hearts of the wicked.
They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment,
which will come upon them suddenly when they least expect it.
They will then say, “Can we be granted some respite?”
Do they really seek to hasten Our punishment?
Tell me [O Prophet] if We give them a life of ease for years,
then there came to them what they were warned of,
what would avail them the life of ease that they were given?
We never destroyed any town without sending them warners,
to admonish them, for We are never unjust.
This [Qur’an] is not sent down by the devils,
it is not for them to do this, nor is it within their capability,
for they are strictly barred from overhearing it.
So do not call upon any other god besides Allah, lest you become of those who will be punished.
And warn [starting with] the nearest kinsfolk,
and lower your wing [in kindness] to the believers who follow you.
But if they disobey you, say, “I disown what you do.”
And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,
Who sees you when you stand up [for prayer],
and your movements among those who prostrate.
Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Shall I inform you upon who the devils descend?
They descend upon every sinful liar,
who whisper hearsay in the ears, but most of them are liars.
As for poets, they are followed by the deviants.
Do you not see that they wander aimlessly in every valley,
and that they say what they do not do?
Except those who believe, do righteous deeds, remember Allah much and defend themselves after being wronged. The wrongdoers will come to know what end awaits them.
