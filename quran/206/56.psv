When the Inevitable Event comes to pass,
there will be none to deny its occurrence;
it will bring some low and raise others up.
When the earth will be shaken violently,
and the mountains crushed to pieces,
and turn to scattered dust,
then you are sorted into three groups:
the people of the right – how blessed will be the people of the right!
The people of the left – how miserable will be the people of the left!
And the forerunners [in faith] are the forerunners [in Paradise].
They are the nearest ones [to Allah],
in Gardens of Bliss,
many from the early generations,
and a few from the later generations.
[They will be seated] on jeweled couches,
reclining on them, facing one another.
They will be served by immortal youths
with cups, pitchers, and glasses [of wine] from a flowing spring,
which will neither cause any headache nor intoxication,
along with fruits of their choice,
and flesh of birds that they may desire.
And [they will have] maidens of wide gorgeous eyes,
like pristine pearls,
as a reward for what they used to do.
They will not hear therein any idle talk or sinful speech,
except the words of peace, peace.
The people of the right – how blessed will be the people of the right!
[They will be] amid thornless lote trees,
and clusters of bananas,
and shade long-extended,
and flowing water,
and abundant fruit –
neither ceasing nor restricted –
and mattresses raised high [on beds].
Indeed, We have perfectly created them [their spouses],
and have made them virgins,
loving and of equal age,
for the people of the right,
many from the earlier generations,
and many from the later generations.
And the people of the left – how wretched will be the people of the left!
[They will be] in scorching wind and scalding water,
in the shade of black smoke,
neither cool nor refreshing.
Indeed, they used to be in luxuries before,
and persisted in the gravest sin [of polytheism].
They used to say, "When we die and become dust and bones, will we really be raised again?
And our forefathers as well?”
Say, [O Prophet], “Indeed, the former and later generations
will be gathered on a predetermined Day.
Then you, O misguided deniers,
will surely eat from the tree of zaqqūm,
filling your bellies with it,
and drinking scalding water on top of it,
drinking like thirsty camels do.”
This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment.
It is We Who created you; will you not then believe [in resurrection]?
Have you thought about the semen that you emit?
Is it you who create it, or is it We Who are the Creator?
We have ordained death among you, and nothing can overcome us
from transforming you and recreating you in forms that you do not know.
You are well aware of the first creation; why do you not then take heed?
Have you thought about what you sow?
Is it you who cause it grow, or is it We Who make it grow?
If We willed, We could reduce your harvest to crumble, leaving you to wonder and lament,
“We suffered loss,
rather, we are deprived.”
Have you thought about the water that you drink?
Is it you who bring it down from the clouds, or is it We Who bring it down?
If We willed, We could make it salty; will you not then give thanks?
Have you thought about the fire that you kindle?
Is it you who produced its trees, or is it We Who produced it?
We made it a reminder [of the Hellfire] and a benefit for the travelers.
So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
I do swear by the positions of the stars –
and this is indeed a great oath, if only you knew –
that this is indeed a noble Qur’an,
in a well-preserved Record,
that none can touch except the purified [angels] –
a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
Do you take this discourse lightly,
and instead [of thanking Allah] for the provision you are given, you show ingratitude?
Then why [you are helpless] when the soul reaches the throat,
while you are looking on,
when We are closer to him than you, but you do not see?
If you are not subject to retribution, then why do you not
bring that [soul] back, if you are truthful?
If that dying person is one of those who will be brought near to Allah,
then [he will have] comfort, fragrance, and Garden of Bliss.
If he is one of the people of the right,
[He will be told], “Peace be to you, for being one of the people of the right.”
But if he is one of the misguided deniers,
then he will be welcomed with scalding water,
and he will burn in Blazing Fire.
This is indeed the absolute truth.
So glorify the name of your Lord, the Most Great.
