and by the promised Day,
and by the witness and the witnessed,

the fire full of fuel,

Indeed, the punishment of you Lord is severe.
Indeed, it is He Who originates [the creation] then repeats it,
and He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Affectionate,
the Lord of the Glorious Throne;
He does whatever He wills.
Has there not come to you the story of the forces
of Pharaoh and Thamūd?
But the disbelievers are in persistent denial,
although Allah encompasses them from all sides.
But this is a glorious Qur’an,
[inscribed] in a Preserved Tablet.
