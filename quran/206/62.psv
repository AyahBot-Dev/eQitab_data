All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
It is He Who has sent among the unlettered [Arabs] a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and Wisdom [sunnah], although before that they were clearly misguided.
And [he is also sent] to others of them who have not yet joined them, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
That is the bounty of Allah that He gives to whom He wills, for Allah is the Lord of great bounty.
The similitude of those who were given the Torah but failed to uphold it, is like that of a donkey laden with books. How terrible is the similitude of those who reject the verses of Allah! And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
Say, “O you who are Jews, if you claim that you alone are Allah’s allies apart from all other people, then wish for death, if you are truthful.
But they will never wish for it because of what their hands have sent forth. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.
Say, “The death from which you run away will surely overcome you, then you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”
O you who believe, when the call for prayer is made on Friday, then hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off trading. That is better for you, if only you knew.
When the prayer is over, disperse in the land and seek from the bounty of Allah, and remember Allah much so that you may be successful.
When they see some merchandise or amusement, they rush towards it and leave you standing. Say, “That which is with Allah is better than amusement and merchandise, and Allah is the Best of Providers.”
