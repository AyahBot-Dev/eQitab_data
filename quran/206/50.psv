Qāf. By the Glorious Qur’an!
But they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves, so the disbelievers say, “This is something strange!
What! Is it when we die and become dust [will we return to life]? That is a far-fetched return.”
We certainly know what the earth consumes of them [after their death], and with Us is a Preserved Record.
Rather they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are in a state of confusion.
Have they not then looked at the sky above them – how We built it and adorned it [with stars], and it has no rifts?
And We have spread out the earth and set therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein plants of every pleasant kind,
as a source of insight and a reminder to every slave who turns [to Allah].
And We send down from the sky blessed rain, with which We cause to grow gardens and grain for harvest,
and towering palm trees having clustered fruit,
as a provision for people, and We revive thereby a dead land; likewise will be the resurrection.
The people of Noah rejected [the truth] before them, as well as the people of the Water-pit of Rass and Thamūd,
and so did ‘Ād, Pharaoh, the people of Lot,
and the dwellers of the Forest, and the people of Tubba‘. All of them rejected the messengers, so My warning was fulfilled.
Were We wearied by their first creation? No indeed, yet they are in doubt about the second creation.
We have created man and know what his soul whispers within him, for We are closer to him than his jugular vein.
When the two angel scribes, constantly accompanying him, one on the right, and the other on the left.
Not a single word he utters but there is with him a vigilant watcher, ready [to record it].
The throes of death will come with the truth. This is what you were trying to avoid.
And the Trumpet will be blown; that is the Day of [the given] warning.
Everyone will come, accompanied by an angel to drive him and another to testify.
“You were heedless of this; now We have removed your veil, so your vision is sharp Today.”
His angel-companion will say, “Here is the record ready with me.”
[It will be said to the two angels], “Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever,
every withholder of good, transgressor, and doubter,
who set up with Allah another god. Throw him into the severe punishment.”
His [devil] companion will say, “Our Lord, I did not mislead him, but he himself was far astray.”
Allah will say, “Do not argue in My presence, for I had already given you the warning.
My Word cannot be changed, nor am I unjust to My slaves.”
[Beware of] the Day when We will say to Hell, “Have you reached your fill?” It will say, “Are there any more?”
Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far off.
[It will be said], “This is what you were promised; this is for everyone who constantly turned [to Allah] and was dutiful,
who feared the Most Compassionate unseen, and came with a devoted heart.
Enter it in peace. This is the Day of eternity.”
They will have therein all what they wish for, and We have yet more.
How many nations We destroyed before them [Makkans] who were stronger than them in might! They traveled through the land. Did they find any escape?
Indeed, in that is a reminder for anyone who has a [mindful] heart or lends an attentive ear.
Indeed, We created the heavens and earth and all that is between them in six days, and no weariness touched Us.
So bear patiently [O Prophet] what they say, and glorify the praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset.
And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers.
And listen! On the Day when the Caller will call out from a nearby place,
the Day when they will hear the Blast [of the second Trumpet] in truth. That is the Day of resurrection.
Indeed, it is We Who give life and cause death, and to Us is the final return.
On the Day when the earth will be rent asunder for them as they hasten forth [from their graves]. That is an easy gathering for Us.
We know best what they say, and you are not there to compel them to believe. But remind with the Qur’an those who fear My warning.
