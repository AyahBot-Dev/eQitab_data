Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, He will render their deeds void.
As for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad – which is the truth from their Lord – He will absolve them of their sins and set their condition right.
That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah explains for people their comparisons.
When you encounter the disbelievers [in battle], strike [their] necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind the captives firmly. Later [you may free them] as a favor or for ransom until the war comes to an end. That [is Our command], if Allah had willed, He could have subjected them to punishment, but [He ordered you to fight] to test some of you by means of others. Those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never render their deeds void.
He will guide them, and will set their condition right,
and He will admit them to Paradise, which He has already made known to them.
O you who believe, if you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your steps firm.
As for those who disbelieve, how wretched will be their state! And He will render their deeds void.
That is because they detest what Allah has sent down, so He rendered their deeds worthless.
Have they not traveled through the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly, and a similar end awaits the disbelievers.
That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the disbelievers have no protector.
Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy themselves [in this world] and they eat as cattle eat; their final abode is the Fire.
How many towns We destroyed that were more powerful than your town that expelled you, and there was none to help them.
Are those who possess clear proof from their Lord like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and who follow their own desires?
The likeness of Paradise promised to the righteous is that of a [garden which has] rivers of fresh water; rivers of milk the taste of which never changes; rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of pure honey. They will have therein all kinds of fruit and forgiveness from their Lord. Can they be like those who will abide in the Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink that tears apart their intestines?
Among these [hypocrites] are some who listen to you [O Prophet], but when they leave your presence, they say to those who were given knowledge, “What did he just say?” It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their desires.
As for those follow guidance, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness.
Are they but waiting for the Hour to come upon them by surprise? Already [some of] its signs have appeared. What good will it do them to take heed when it actually befalls them?
Then know [O Prophet] that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sins and for the [the sins of] the believing men and women, for Allah knows your movements and your places of rest.
Those who believe say, “If only a Chapter were sent down [about fighting]? But when a precise Chapter is sent down and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking at you like someone who is about to die. It would have been better for them
to obey and say good words. Once the fighting was ordained, it would be better for them to be truthful to Allah.
Then if you turn away, what else can be expected but that you will spread corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship?
These are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and has made them deaf and has blinded their sight.
Do they not reflect upon the Qur’an, or are there locks upon their hearts?
Indeed, those who turn back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who has tempted them and has deceived them with false hopes of a long life.
That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some matters.” But Allah knows their secret schemes.
How will they feel when the angels take their souls, striking their faces and their backs?
That is because they follow what incurs Allah’s wrath and they hate what pleases Him, so He will render their deeds worthless.
Do those in whose hearts is sickness think that Allah will never expose their malice?
If We willed, We could show them to you [O Prophet], so you would recognize them by their faces, but you will surely recognize them by the manner of their speech. And Allah knows all what you do.
We will certainly test you so as to reveal those of you who struggle [in Allah’s way] and remain patient, and We will test sincerity of your assertions.
Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, and oppose the Messenger after guidance had become clear to them, they will never harm Allah in the least, and He will render their deeds worthless.
O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not cause your deeds to be nullified.
Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, and then die as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them.
Do not lose heart or call for peace, for you will have the upper hand and Allah is with you. And He will never detract [the reward of] your deeds.
The life of this world is only play and amusement. But if you believe and fear Allah, He will give you your rewards, and He does not ask you for all your wealth.
If He were to ask you for it and insist that you give it, you would greedily withhold, and He would expose your resentment [for spending].
O you who are being called to spend in Allah’s way; among you are some who greedily withhold, but whoever withholds, he in fact withholds against himself, for Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you are in need [of Him]. If you turn away, He will replace you with another people, then they will not be like you.
