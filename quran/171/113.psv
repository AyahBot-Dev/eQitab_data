Say, O Messenger: “I seek refuge in the Lord of the morning and I seek His protection.”
“From the evils of the harms of all creation.”
“And I seek refuge in Allah from the evils that appear in the night, i.e. harmful creatures and bandits.”
“And I seek His refuge from the evils of the sorceresses who blow onto knots.”
“And I seek His refuge from the evil of the jealous one when he acts out his jealousy.”
