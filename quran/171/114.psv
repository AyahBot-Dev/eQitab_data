Say, O Messenger: “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind and seek His protection.”
“The King of the people, who does whatever He wishes with them. They do not have any real king other than Him.”
“He is their rightful deity; they do not have any rightful deity except Him.”
“From the evils of Satan who whispers to the human when he is neglectful of the remembrance of Allah, or delays in it when he remembers.”
“He whispers to the hearts of people.”
“And he could be from the humankind or from the Jinn.”
