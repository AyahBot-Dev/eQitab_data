Evil consequences and a severe punishment awaits the one who frequently backbites the people and taunts them.
The one whose only concern is to amass wealth and count it; he has no other concern.
He thinks that the wealth of his he amasses will save him from death, and that he will remain forever in this worldly life.
It is not as this ignorant one thinks; he will surely be thrown into the fire of hell that crushes and breaks everything that is thrown into it, due to its immense strength.
O Messenger! What do you know of this fire that smashes everything that is thrown into it?
Indeed, it is the blazing fire of Allah.
The fire that penetrates the bodies of the people until it reaches their hearts.
Indeed, it will close up around those that will be punished with it.
For a prolonged, lengthy period of time, so long that they will never leave it.
