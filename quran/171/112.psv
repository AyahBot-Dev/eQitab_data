Say, O Messenger: He is Allah who is alone in being a deity. There is no deity except Him.
He is the master to whom belongs all sovereignty and perfect, beautiful qualities. The one to whom all creation turn to.
The one who did not give birth to anyone, nor did anyone give birth to Him. So He has no offspring - may He be glorified - nor any parent.
Nor does He have any equal from His creation.
