Say, O Messenger: O those who disbelieve in Allah!
I do not and will not worship the idols you worship.
Nor are you going to worship what I worship, i.e. Allah alone.
Nor am I going to worship the idols you worship.
Nor are you going to worship what I worship, i.e. Allah alone.
You have your religion you thought up for yourselves, and I have my religion that Allah revealed to me.
