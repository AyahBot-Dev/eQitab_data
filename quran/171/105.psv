O Messenger! Do you not know how your Lord dealt with Abraha and his people: the people of the elephant, when they intended to demolish the Ka‘bah?
Allah made their evil plot to destroy it in vain; they did not achieve what they desired in trying to turn the people away from the Ka‘bah. They did not succeed in the slightest.
Allah sent birds upon them, who came to them in flocks upon flocks.
They pelted them with stones of clay.
So Allah made them like the leaves of crops that have been eaten and trampled upon by livestock.
