Allah takes an oath on the beginning of the day.
And He takes an oath on the night when it darkens and people cease to move in it.
O Messenger! Your Lord has not left you, nor has he begun to hate you, as the idolaters claimed when there was a break in the revelation.
Indeed, the abode of the afterlife is better for you than the worldly one, because of the everlasting bounties that it has.
Very soon He will grant you an abundant reward, and your nation also, until you become content with what He has granted you and your nation.
Verily, He found you at a time when you were a child whose father had passed away, and so He made a place of refuge for you by causing your grandfather Abdul Muttalib to become fond of you, and then your uncle Abu Talib.
He found you in a state where you did not know what revelation or faith was, and so He taught you about that which you did not know.
And He found you poor, so He made you self-sufficient.
Therefore, do not treat badly the one who has lost his father in childhood, nor look down upon him.
And do not rebuke the needy beggar.
And be grateful for the favours of Allah upon you, and talk about them.
