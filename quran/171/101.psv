The hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors.
What is this hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors?
O Messenger! And what do you know of this hour that strikes the hearts of people because of the severity of its horrors? It is the Day of Judgement.
On the day when the hearts of people will be struck, they will be like locusts, dispersed here and there.
And the mountains will be like carded wool, in the way they will move from their places with force.
As for the one whose good deeds will outweigh his evil deeds.
He will live a contented life which he will achieve in Paradise.
And as for the one whose evil deeds outweigh his good deeds.
His abode and permanent resting place will be hell on the Day of Judgement.
O Messenger! What do you know what that is?
It is the intensely hot hellfire.
