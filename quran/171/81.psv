When the mass of the sun is gathered and its light vanishes.
When the stars fall one after the other and their light is taken away.
When the mountains are moved from their places.
When pregnant she-camels, which were their most valuable wealth, are neglected by being abandoned by their owners.
When wild animals are gathered with human beings on one plain.
When the seas are lit until they become a fire.
When souls are joined with their likeness. A sinner will be joined with a sinner and a pious person will be joined with a pious person.
When the girl buried alive is asked by Allah.
For what crime were you killed by the person who killed you?
When the servants’ books of deeds are spread open, so that each person can read his book of deeds.
When the sky is stripped like how the skin is stripped away from a sheep.
When the Fire is lit.
When Paradise is brought near to those who are Mindful.
When that occurs, every soul will know what actions it sent forward for that day.
Allah took an oath by the stars that are hidden until they emerge at night.
That run in their orbits and disappear when dawn rises, like a gazelle that goes into its den i.e. its home.
He took an oath by the first part of the night when it approaches, and the last part when it recedes.
He took an oath by the morning when its light emerges.
The Qur’ān that is revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah’s speech that was conveyed by a trusted angel, Gabriel (peace be upon him), whom Allah entrusted it to.
One who possess strength and great rank in the sight of the Lord of the Throne, may He be glorified.
He is obeyed by the inhabitants of the heavens and trusted in the revelation that he conveys.
Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is in your company and whose intellect, trustworthiness and truthfulness you know, is not insane as you slanderously claim.
Your companion had seen Gabriel in the form that he was created in the clear horizon of the sky.
Your companion is not miserly with you by not conveying what he was instructed to convey to you, nor does he take any reward like how fortune-tellers take.
This Qur’ān is not the speech of a satan distanced from Allah’s mercy.
So which path will you tread to deny that it is from Allah after all these evidence?!
The Qur’ān is only a reminder and counsel to the jinn and mankind.
For those of you who wish to be steadfast on the path of truth.
You can only will to remain steadfast or do anything else if Allah, the Lord of all created things, wills that.
