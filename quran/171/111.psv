Both hands of the uncle of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Abū Lahab son of ‘Abdul Muṭṭalib have lost because of the loss of his actions; he used to harm the Prophet (peace be upon him). His efforts are in vain.
How much can his wealth and his children benefit him? They cannot defend him against the punishment, nor bring any mercy to him.
On the Day of Judgement, he will soon enter the flaring hellfire and suffer its heat.
And his wife Umm Jamīl who would also harm the Prophet (peace be upon him) by throwing thorns into his path, will also enter it.
Around her neck will be tightly bound a rope with which she will be dragged into the hellfire.
