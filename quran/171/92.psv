Allah takes an oath on the night when it covers whatever is between the heavens and the earth with its darkness.
And Allah takes an oath on the day when it becomes clear and visible.
And He takes an oath on His creating the two genders: The male and female.
O people! Your actions are different: some are good, which are the causes of entering Paradise, while others are evil, which are the causes of entering the hellfire.
As for the one who gives whatever is necessary for him to spend, i.e. Zakat, financial support and repatriation, and is mindful of that which Allah has prohibited him from.
And he believes in the substitute Allah has promised him.
I shall soon make performing good deeds and spending in My path easy for him.
And as for the one who is miserly with his wealth and does not spend it in the avenues necessary for him to spend in, thinking himself to be in no need of Allah and not asking Allah for any of His grace.
Whilst rejecting the substitute and reward Allah has promised him if he spends his wealth in His path.
I will soon make performing evil deeds easy for him, and make difficult doing good.
His wealth that he is miserly with will not benefit him at all when he dies and enters the hellfire.
Indeed, it is My responsibility to make the path of truth clear from the path of falsehood.
And indeed, the afterlife and the worldly life belongs to Me; I do whatever I want with it. That is not the case with anyone else.
So O people! If you disobey Me, I warn you of the hellfire which is being kindled.
None will suffer the heat of this fire except the most wretched, i.e. the disbeliever.
The one who rejected whatever the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought, and turned away from fulfilling the command of Allah.
The most Allah-conscious of the people will be distanced from it, i.e. Abu Bakr.
The one who spends his wealth in righteous avenues, to purify himself of sins.
He does not spend whatever wealth he spends, to repay any favour done to him by anyone.
Through his spending, he only intends the pleasure of his Lord who is High above His creation.
And indeed, soon, he will be pleased with the generous reward Allah will grant him.
