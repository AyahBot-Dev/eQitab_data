Verily, Allah has opened up your heart for you and made receiving revelation beloved to you.
And I have removed sin from you.
That which was burdening you to the extent that it almost broke your back.
And I elevated for you your mention, so you are now remembered in the call to prayer, and the call preceding the prayer, and at other times.
Indeed, with difficulty and constraint, comes ease and options.
Indeed, with difficulty and constraint, comes ease and options; when you know that well, the troubling of your people will not terrify you and will not stop you from calling towards Allah.
So when you finish your work and complete it, strive in the worship of your Lord.
And divert your passion and resolve towards Allah alone.
