When the heaven will be cloven.
And will listen (submissively) to its Lord- and it will be truly bound to (do so)-
And when the earth will be widely extended,
And will cast forth what is in it and will void itself,
And will listen (submissively) to its Lord- and it will be truly bound to (do so)-
O you man, surely you are exerting yourself to your Lord with great exertion, then you will be meeting Him.
So, as for him who is brought his Book in his right (hand),
Then he will eventually be reckoned an easy reckoning,
And he will turn over (Ingalaba: Literally: turn over) to his family pleased.
And as for him who is brought his Book beyond his back,
Then he will call for detriment,
And he will roast at a Blaze.
Surely he (once lived) among his family, pleasured;
Surely he surmised he would never recede (Or: return).
Yes indeed, his Lord has been Ever-Beholding (of) him.
Yet no! I swear by the twilight,
And the night and whatever load it has,
And the moon when it grows full-
Indeed you will definitely ride state after state (i.e., travel from one stage "of life" to another).
For what reason then do they not believe?
And when the Qur'an is read to them, they do not prostrate themselves?*
No indeed, (but) the ones who have disbelieved are crying lies,
And Allah knows best whatever they heedfully harbor (in their breasts).
So give them tidings of a painful torment,
Except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness- they will have a reward bountifully unfailing.
