And by those ranged in ranks ranging,
Then by the scarers scaring, (This is sometimes meat that the Angles perform such acts)
Then by the reciters of a Remembrance,
Surely your God is indeed One,
The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them both and The Lord of the easts.
Surely We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment, the planets,
And (as) a preservation against every insurgent Shatan. (Ever Â– vicious (one), i.e., devil).
They do not overhear the most Exalted Chiefs, (i.e., angels) and they are pelted (with hurled meteors) from every side,
Rejected, and they will have a lasting torment,
Except him who snatches a snatching (away); then a piercing flaming (meteor) follows him up.
So ask them for a pronouncement: "Are they more valiant as a creation or the ones We created? Surely We created them of clinging clay."
No indeed, you wonder, and they scoff,
And when they are reminded, they do not remember.
And when they see a sign, they turn it to scoffing.
And they have said, "Decidedly this is nothing except an evident sorcery.
When we die and are dust and bones, will we surely be made to rise again indeed?
And our earliest fathers?"
Say, "Yes, and you will be (utterly) abject."
So, surely it is only one scaring, then only then, they are looking on.
And they say, "oh woe to us! This is the Day of Doom." (Or: Judgment; Religion)
This is the Day of Verdict, which you used to cry lies to.
Muster the ones who did injustice, and their spouses, and whatever they were worshiping.
Apart from Allah, and so guide them to the path of Hell-Fire.
And bid them stand; surely they are to be questioned,
How is it that you do not vindicate one another?
No indeed; (but) they are today submitting themselves.
And some of them come forward to others, (Literally: some (others) asking one another (questions).
They (The seduced) say, "Surely you used to come up to us from the right hand." (i.e. with the Truth).
They say, "No indeed, but you were not believers.
And in no way did we have any all- binding authority over you; no indeed, (but) you were an inordinate people."
"So, our Lord's Word (Literally: Saying) has come true against us; surely we are indeed tasting (it).
So we have misguided you; surely we were (ourselves) misguided."
So, upon that Day, surely they are partners in the torment.
Surely thus We perform against the criminals.
Surely when it was said to them, "There is no god except Allah, " they were waxing proud.
And they said, "Shall we surely be leaving indeed our gods for a mad poet?"
No indeed, (but) he has come with the Truth and has sincere (faith) in the Emissaries.
Surely you will indeed be tasting the painful torment;
And in no way will you be recompensed, except according to whatever you were doing.
Except for the most faithful bondmen of Allah.
For those there is a known provision-
Fruits-and they will be honored.
In the Gardens of Bliss.
On settees, facing one another.
A cup from a profuse (spring) is passed round for them-
White, delicious to the drinkers-
Wherein there is no insobriety, (Or: havoc, danger) nor are they exhausted (Or: inebriated) thereby.
And in their presence are wide-eyed (maidens), restraining their glances.
As if they were white nestled (jewels).
So some of them come forward to others, (Literally: some (others) asking one another (questions).
A speaker of them says, "Surely I used to have a comrade.
He (always) said, Are you surely of the ones who indeed count it sincerely (verified)?
When we die and are dust and bones, will we surely be doomed (Or: judged) indeed?"
He says, "Are you (all) viewing (him)?"
So he views (him), and then sees him in the (deepest) level of the Hell-Fire.
He says, "By Allah, (The Arabic is ta-llahi; which a stronger oath than the more usual wa-llahi) decidedly you were almost about to topple me down indeed.
And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, indeed I would have been among the ones presented forward.
Then in no way will we be dead,
Except for our first death, and in no way will we be tormented?
Surely this is indeed that which is magnificent triumph;
For the like of this let the doers do (good deeds)."
Is this a more charitable (i.e., better) hospitality, or even the Tree of Az-Zaqqum?
Surely We have made it as a temptation (Or: trial) for the unjust.
Surely it is a tree that comes out (Literally: goes out) in the root of Hell-Fire;
Its spathes are as the heads of Shayatun. (Ever-vicious (ones), i.e., devils)
Then surely they will indeed be eating of it, and so of it they will be filling their bellies.
Thereafter on top of it surely they will have indeed an admixture of scalding (water),
Thereafter surely their return indeed is to Hell-Fire.
Surely they came upon their fathers erring,
So they are made to hurry in their tracks.
And indeed before them already erred away most of the earliest (people),
And indeed We already sent among them warners.
So look into how was the end of the warned people,
Except for the most faithful bondmen of Allah.
And indeed, Nuh (Noah) already called out to Us; (i.e., Allah, through the Angels) so how excellent indeed were The Answerers!
And We safely delivered him and his family from the tremendous agony;
And We made his offspring the ones who are the (enduring) survivors;
And We have left for him (honor) among the later (generations):
Peace be upon Nuh (Noah) among the worlds!
Surely thus do We recompense the fair-doers.
Surely he is among Our believing bondmen.
Thereafter We drowned the others.
And surely of his sect indeed was Ibrahim (Abraham)
As he came to his Lord with a sound heart,
As he said to his father and his people, "What is it that you worship?
Is it a falsehood, gods apart from Allah, that you are willing (to worship)?
What then is your expectation from The Lord of the worlds?"
So he looked a look (i.e., gazed at the stars) at the stars,
Yet he said, "Surely I am ailing."
Then they turned away from him, withdrawing.
So he went apart to their gods; then he said, "Will you not eat?
How is it with you that you do not pronounce (a word)
So he went apart upon them (i.e., their idols) striking with his right hand.
Then they (i.e., the disbelievers) came forward to him in a hurried procession.
He said, "Do you worship what you hew,
And Allah created you and whatever you do?
They said, "Build him a structure, (and) then cast him in the Hell-Fire."
So they were willing to devise a plot against him; yet We made them the basest.
And he said, "Surely I am going to my Lord, soon He will guide me.
Lord! Bestow upon me one of the righteous."
So We gave him the good tidings of a forbearing youth.
Then when he (His son) reached the age of endeavoring with him, he said, "O my son, surely I see in a dream (Literally: time of sleeping) that I should slay you; so, look, what do you see?" He said, "O my (dear) father, perform whatever you are commanded; you will soon find me, in case Allah (so) decides, among the patient."
So, as soon as they had both surrendered, and he dashed him upon his brow.
And We called out to him (saying), "O Ibrahim, (Abraham).
you have already sincerely (believed) in the vision; surely thus We recompense the fair-doers.
Surely this is indeed what is the evident trial."
And We ransomed him with a magnificent slain (sacrifice).
And We have left for him among the later generations,
"Peace be upon Ibrahim." (Abraham)
Thus We recompense the fair-doers;
Surely he is one of Our believing bondmen.
And We gave him the good tidings of Ishaq, (Isaac) a Prophet, one of the righteous.
And We blessed him and Ishaq, and of their (The pronoun is dual; i.e., offspring of the two of them) offspring some are fair-doers, and (some) are evidently unjust to themselves.
And indeed We were already bounteous to Musa (Moses) and Harun. (Aron)
And We safely delivered them both and their people from the tremendous agony.
And We granted them victory, so that they were the ones (who were) overcomers;
And We brought them both the Evidential Book;
And We guided them both in the straight Path;
And We have left for them both among the later (generations),
"Peace be upon Musa and Harun."
Surely thus We recompense the fair-doers.
Surely they are both of Our believing bondmen.
And surely Ilyas (Alias=Elijah) is indeed one of the Emissaries;
As he said to his people, "Will you not be pious (towards Allah)?
Do you invoke Bacl, and leave out The Fairest of creators,
Allah, your Lord, and The Lord of your earliest fathers?"
Yet they cried him lies; then surely they will indeed be presented forward?"
Except for the most faithful bondmen of Allah.
And We have left for him (honor) in the later generations,
Peace be upon Ilyasin!" (Elias)
Surely thus We recompense the fair-doers.
Surely he is one of Our believing bondmen.
And surely Lut (Lot) is indeed one of the Emissaries,
As We safely delivered him and his family all together,
Except an old woman among the laggards;
Thereafter We destroyed the others,
And surely you pass by them in the (early) morning.
And by night; Will you not then consider?
And surely Yunus (Jonah) is indeed one of the Emissaries, 0
As he deserted to the laden ship (s);
Then he cast lots. Yet he was of the rebutted,
So the whale gobbled him, and he was blameworthy.
So had he not been of the extollers (of Allah),
He would indeed have lingered in its belly until the Day they will be made to rise again.
Then We flung him off upon the naked (shore) and he was ailing.
And We caused to grow over him a tree of gourds.
And We sent him to a hundred thousand, or more. (Literally: they may have increased)
Then they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while.
So, ask them for a pronouncement, "Has your Lord daughters, and they have sons?
Or even did We create the Angels females, and they were witnesses?"
Verily, surely it is of their falsehood, indeed, (that) they say,
" Allah has begotten!" And surely they are liars indeed.
Has he elected daughters above sons?
How is it with you, how do you judge?
Will you then not be mindful?
Or even do you have an evident all- binding authority?
Then come up with your Book, in case you are sincere.
And they have made up a consanguity between Him and the jinn; and indeed the jinn already know that surely they will indeed be presented forward.
All Extolment be to Allah above what they describe.
Except (for) the most faithful bondmen of Allah.
Yet surely you and whatever you worship,
In no way will you tempt any against Him,
Except (for) him who will roast in Hell-Fire".
And in no way is there one of us, (i.e., the angels) except that he has a known station,
And surely we, indeed we, are the ones ranged in ranks,
And surely we, indeed we, are the extollers (of Allah)."
And decidedly they (i.e., the disbelievers) indeed used to say,
"If only we had in our presence a Remembrance (i.e., Scriptures) from the earliest (people).
Indeed we would be the most faithful bondmen of Allah."
Yet they disbelieved in it; then eventually they will know!
And indeed Our Word has already gone before to Our bondmen, the Emissaries.
Surely they, indeed they, will be vindicated,
And surely Our hosts, indeed they, will be the overcomers.
So turn away from them for a while.
And behold them; then they will eventually behold.
Do they then seek to hasten Our torment?
So when it comes down in their courtyard, then how odious will be the morning of them that are constantly warned!
And turn away from them for a while
And behold; then they will eventually behold.
All Extolment be to your Lord, The Lord of Might, above whatever they describe!
And peace be upon the Emissaries;
And praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds.
