When the sun will be rolled, (i.e., folded; compressed).
And when the stars will be turbid,
And when the mountains will be made to travel,
And when the (she-camels) ten-months with young are untended,
And when the savage beasts will be mustered,
And when the seas will be seething,
And when the (inner) selves will be paired, (i.e., joined to their bodies)
And when the female infant buried alive will be asked.
For whichever guilty deed she was killed,
And when the Scrolls will be unrolled,
And when the heaven will be scraped off,
And when the Hell-Fire will be set blazing,
And when the Garden will be drawn within reach-
(Then) a self will know whatever it has presented.
Then no! swear by the constant sinkers,
The running "stars", the constant sinkers,
And by the night when it darkens, (Or: swarms)
And by the morning when it breathes,
Surely it is indeed the Saying of an honorable Messenger (The Angel Jibril "Gabriel")
Owning power, established in the Providence of The Owner of the Throne,
Obeyed there, (and) devoted.
And in no ay is your companion (The Prophet) a madman.
And indeed he (The Prophet) already saw him (The Angle Jibril "Gabriel") on the evident horizon,
And in no way is he reluctant with the Unseen (i.e., the Prophet saw Jibril).
And in no way is it the saying of an outcast Shaytan (Ever-vicious "one", i.e., devil)
Where then are you (The pronoun is plural) going?
Decidedly it is nothing except a Remembrance to the worlds
For whomever of you who decides to go straight;
And in no way can you decide except "when" Allah "so" decides, The Lord of the worlds.
