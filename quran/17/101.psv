The Smiter!
What is the Smiter?
And what makes you realize what the Smiter is?
The Day (whereon) mankind will be like disseminated moths,
And the mountains will be like carded wool tufts,
Then, as for him whose scales weigh heavy, (i.e., with good deeds).
So he will be in a satisfied livelihood.
And, as for him whose scales weigh light, (i.e., with deeds).
Then his home is the bottom of Hell (Literally: his mother is tumbling into Hell).
And what makes you realize what it is?
(It is) a Fire burning hot.
