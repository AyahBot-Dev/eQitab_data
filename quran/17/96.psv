Read: In the Name of your Lord Who created,
Created man from clots.
Read: And your Lord is The Most Honorable,
Who taught by the pen.
He taught man what he did not know.
Not at all! Surely man does indeed (grow) inordinate.
That he sees himself becoming self-sufficient.
Surely to your Lord is the Returning.
Have you seen him who forbids.
A bondman when he prays?
Have you seen in case he is upon guidance
Or he commands (people) to piety?
Have you seen in case he cries lies and turns away?
Does he not know that Allah sees?
Not at all! Indeed in case he does not refrain, We will indeed trail him by the forelock,
A lying, sinful forelock.
So let him call upon his assembly!
We will call upon the guards of Hell.
Not at all! Do not obey him, and prostrate yourself, and draw near (to Allah).
