When the heaven will be rent asunder,
And when the planets will be strewn,
And when the seas will be made to gush forth,
And when the tombs will be scattered away-
A self will know whatever it has forwarded and deferred.
O you man! What has deluded you concerning your Ever-Honorable Lord,
Who created you, then molded you, then proportioned you?
In whichever fashion He (so) decides, He compounds you.
Not at all! No indeed, (but) you cry lies to the Doom.
And surely there are indeed over you Preservers,
Honorable Writers,
(Who) know whatever you perform.
Surely the constantly benign will indeed be in Bliss,
And surely the constantly impious will indeed be in Hell-Fire,
Roasting therein on the Day of Doom.
And in no way will they be absent from it.
And what makes you realize what the Day of Doom is?
Again, (Literally: Thereafter) what makes you realize what the Day of Doom is?
A Day when no self will possess anything (to help) another self; and the Command upon that Day belongs to Allah.
