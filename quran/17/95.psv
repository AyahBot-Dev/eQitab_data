And (by) the fig and the olive,
And (by) Tur Sinin (Mount Sinai).
And (by) this devoted (Or: secure, i.e., the city of Makkah) Country!
Indeed We already created man in the fairest stature;
Thereafter We turned him back to the basest of the base,
Except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness; so (these) will have a reward bountifully unfailing.
Then what will cry you lies hereafter as to the Doom? (Or: the Religion)
Is not Allah The Most Judicious of Judges?
