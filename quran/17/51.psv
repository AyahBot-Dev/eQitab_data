And (by) the winnowers with (swift) winnowing.
Then (by) the bearers of heavy burdens, (Or: obstruction).
Then (by) the runners with ease,
Then (by) the dividers by the Command.
Surely what you are promised is indeed sincere.
And surely the Doom is indeed befalling.
And (by) the heaven comprising interwoven tracks,
Surely you (The pronoun is plural) are indeed of a different opinion, (Literally: of a different saying)
Diverged therefrom whoever is diverged (from truth).
Slain are the constant conjecturers,
They who are unmindful and in perplexity (about the Hereafter),
Asking, "When is the Day of Doom?"
The Day when it is they (who) will be tempted (Or: tried) at the Fire;
"Taste your temptation! (Or: trial) This is what you were seeking to hasten."
Surely the pious will be in (the midst of) Gardens and Springs,
Taking whatever their Lord has brought them; surely, they were fair-doers before that.
They used to slumber (only) little of the night;
And before dawn, it is they (who) would seek forgiveness.
And in their riches, the beggar and the dispossessed have what is truthfully their due.
And in the earth are signs for the ones having certitude,
And in your selves; do you then not behold?
And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised.
So by The Lord of the heaven and the earth, surely it is indeed true as (it is true) that you (can) pronounce (your languages).
Has the discourse about Ibrahim's (Abraham) honored guests come up (to your knowledge)?
As they entered to him, then they said, "Peace!" He said, "Peace! (You) are a people disclaimed (by me)." (i.e., not recognized by me)
So he went apart to his family, then came with a plump calf;
So he laid it near them and said, "Will you not eat?"
Then he entertained a fright of them. They said, "Do not fear (anything)." And they gave him good tidings of a knowledgeable youth.
So came forward his wife, clamoring; (literally: with a clamor) then she beat her face, and said, "An old sterile woman!"
They said, "Thus your Lord has said; surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Wise, The Ever-Knowing."
Said he, "So, what is your concern, you Emissaries?"
They said, "Surely we have been sent to a criminal people,
To send upon them stones of clay
Marked in the Reckoning of your Lord for the extravagant."
Then We brought out whoever of the believers who were in it,
Yet, in no way did We find therein other than one house of Muslims; (i.e., those who surrender themselves to Allah).
And We have left in it a sign to the ones who fear the painful torment.
And (also there is a sign) in Musa (Moses) as We sent him to Firaawn (pharaoh) with an evident, all- binding authority.
Yet he turned away, with his (court) supporters, and said, "A sorcerer or a madman."
So We took him (away) and his hosts; then We flung them off in the main, (and) he was blameworthy.
And (also there is a sign) in c?d as We sent against them the sterile wind.
In no way did it come upon anything except that it left it out (and) made it as a rotten (stuff).
And (also there is a sign) in Thamud as it was said to them, "Take your enjoyment for a while."
Yet they rebelled against the Command of their Lord; so that stunning (thunderbolt) took them (away) (while) they were looking on.
So in no way were they able to be upright, and in no way were they vindicators.
And the people of Nuh (Noah) earlier, surely they were an immoral people.
And the heaven (is also a sign). We have built it with (Our) Hands (i.e., Capability) and surely We are indeed extending (it) wide.
And the earth, We have laid it out (as) a bedding, so how excellent are the Smoothers! (i.e., Those who make the earth as a cradle)
And of everything We created pairs, that possibly you would be mindful.
"So flee to Allah! Surely I am an evident, constant warner from Him to you.
And do not set up with Allah another god; surely I am an evident, constant warner from Him to you."
Thus in no way did (any) Messenger come up to the ones even before them except that they said, "A sorcerer or a madman."
Have they enjoined (this saying) one to another? No indeed, (but) they are an inordinate people.
Then turn back from them; so in no way are you blameworthy.
And remind; then surely reminding profits the believers.
And in no way did I create the jinn and humankind except to worship Me.
In no way would I have from them any provision; and in no way would I have them to feed Me.
Surely Allah is The Superb Provider, The Owner of Power, The Ever-Pervading.
Then surely the ones who did injustice will have an allotment like the allotment of their companions; so let them not seek to hasten Me!
So woe to the ones who have disbelieved from their Day which they are promised.
