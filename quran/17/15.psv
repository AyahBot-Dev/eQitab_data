Alif, Lam, Mim, Ra (These are the names of letters of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here). Those are the ayat (Verses, signs) of the Book and an Evident Qur'an.
(Probably) the ones who have disbelieved would often rather like that if they were Muslims.
Leave them out to eat and enjoy (life), and let (false) aspiration divert them; then eventually they will know.
And in no way did We cause any town to perish except that it had a known (prescribed) Book.
In no way can any nation outstrip its term, and in no way will they (be able) to postpone it.
And they said, "O you upon whom the Remembrance is being sent down, surely you are indeed a madman.
Would you ever come up with the Angels to us, in case you are of the sincere?"
In no way do We send down the Angels except with the Truth; and lo, in no way would they (The disbelievers) be respited.
Surely We, Ever We, have been sending down the Remembrance, and surely We are indeed Preservers of it.
And indeed We sent (Messengers) even before you among the sects of the earliest (people).
And in no way did a Messenger come up to them except that they used to mock at him.
Thus We insert it (Disbelief) into the hearts of the criminals.
They do not believe in it; (The Message) and the enactment (The reward for good and evil) (for) the earliest (people) has already passed away.
And (even) if We opened upon them a gate of the heaven (and) so they linger on winding up through it,
They would indeed say, "Surely it is only that our be holdings (i.e., eyesights) are stupefied; no indeed, we are a people bewitched!"
And indeed We have already made in the heaven constellations, and We have adorned it to the onlookers.
And We have preserved it from every outcast Shaytan (The all-vicious, i.e., the Devil).
Excepting him who (gains) hearing by stealth, (and) so an evidently flaming (meteor) follows him up.
And the earth-We have extended it and cast on it anchorages, (i.e., mountains) and We have caused to grow therein of everything (evenly) weighed.
And We have made for you (means of) subsistence therein and for the ones you do not even provide for (Literally: for whom you are not providers).
And decidedly there is not a thing excepting that its treasuries are in Our Providence, and in no way do We send it down except in a known estimate.
And We send the winds impregnating, (and) so We send down from the heaven water, then We give it to you to drink, and in no way can you even be its treasurers.
And surely We, Ever We, indeed give life and make to die, and We are the inheritors.
And indeed We already know the ones of you who can go forward, and indeed We already know the ones who can postpone.
And surely your Lord, Ever He, will muster them; surely He is Ever-Wise, Ever-Knowing.
And indeed We already created man of dry clay of mud modeled.
And the jinn race We created earlier of the fire (The Arabic word samum is sometimes understood to be pestilential wind) of a pestilential (fire).
And as your Lord said to the Angels, "Surely I am creating a mortal of dry clay of mud modeled.
So, when I have molded him and breathed into him of My Spirit, fall down to him prostrating!"
So the Angels prostrated themselves, all of them together.
Except Iblis; he refused to be among the prostrate.
Said He, "O Iblis, what about you, that you are not among the prostrate?"
Said he, "Indeed I did not have to prostrate myself to a mortal whom You created of dry clay of mud modeled."
Said He, "Then get out (Literally: go out) of it; so, surely you are outcast.
And surely the curse will be upon you till the Day of Doom."
Said he, "Lord! Then respite me till the Day they will be made to rise again."
Said He, "Then surely you are among the respited,
To the Day of a known time."
Said he, "Lord! For (the fact) that You misguided me, indeed I will definitely adorn for them (i.e., make "evil" attractive to them) in the earth; and indeed I will definitely misguide them all together,
Excepting Your bondmen among them, who are most faithful."
Said He, "This is for Me a straight Path.
Surely over My bondmen you will have no all-binding authority, except the ones who closely follow you of the misguided ones."
And surely Hell will be indeed their promised (abode) all together.
It has seven gates; and each gate has an appointed part (Literally: divided).
Surely the pious will be amidst Gardens and Springs."
"Enter them, in peace, secure!"
And We will draw out from them whatever rancor may be in their breasts; as brethren they will be upon settees facing one another.
No toil will touch them therein, and in no way will they be made to go out of it.
Fully inform My bondmen that I, Ever I, am The Ever-Forgiving, The Ever-Merciful,
And that My torment is the (most) painful torment.
And fully inform them about the guests of Ibrahim, (Abraham)
As they entered to him (and) so they said, "Peace!" He said, "Surely we feel tremulous of you."
They said, "Do not feel tremulous. Surely we give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable youth."
He said, "Do you give me glad tidings, though being great (with years) has touched me? (i.e., I am an old man) Of what do you give me glad tidings?"
They said, "We have given you glad tidings with the truth, so do not be of the ones who are despondent."
He said, "And who is despondent of the mercy of his Lord excepting the erring?"
He said, "So, what is your concern, you Emissaries?"
They said, "Surely we have been sent to a criminal people,
Excepting the household of Lut; (Lot) surely we will indeed safely deliver them all together,
Excepting his wife. We have determined (that) surely she will indeed be of the laggards."
So, as soon as the Emissaries came to the house of Lut; (Lot).
He said, "Surely you are a people unrecognized (by me)."
They said, "No indeed, we have come to you with that about which they were wrangling;
And we have come up to you with the truth; and surely we are indeed sincere.
So set forth with your family in a watch of the night and closely follow after them in the rear, and let not any of you turn round; and pass away to (the place) where you are commanded."
And We decreed for him that Command, that the last trace of these was to be cut off in the (early) morning.
And the population of the city came (to witness) the glad tidings.
He said, "Surely these are my guests; so do not put me to shame.
And be pious to Allah and do not disgrace me."
They said, "Have we not forbidden you (to entertain all) men?" (Literally: the worlds)
He said, "These are my daughters (to marry), if you would be performing (that)."
By your life, surely they were indeed blundering in their stupor.
Then the Shout took them (away) at sunshine.
So We turned it upside-down, and We rained upon them stones of baked clay.
Surely in that are indeed signs for the scrutinizers (i.e., Those who look for the destroyed cities).
And surely it is indeed on a way that still exists.
Surely in that is indeed a sign for the believers.
And decidedly the companions of the Thicket (i.e., the dwellers of Madyan) were indeed unjust.
So We took vengeance on them; and surely the two of them were indeed on an evident record (or: register, literally:Imam).
And indeed the companions (i.e., the inhabitants) of Al- Hijr readily cried lies to the Emissaries.
And We brought them Our signs, yet they were veering away from them.
And they used to hew the mountains into homes, (therein dwelling) securely.
So the Shout took them (away) in the (early) morning.
Then in no way did whatever they used to earn avail them.
And in no way did We create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them except with the Truth; and surely the Hour is indeed coming up, so pardon, with becoming pardoning.
Surely your Lord, He is The Sublime Creator, The Ever-Knowing.
And indeed We have already brought you seven of the oft-repeated (i.e., the Opening Surah " Al-Fatihah", as it includes praise and laudation in seven verses) and the magnificent Qur'an.
Do not definitely extend forth your eyes to what We have given pairs of them to enjoy; and be not grieved for them, and lower your wing to the believers.
And say, "Surely, I, constantly I, am the evident warner."
Just as We sent down upon those who divide among themselves, (i.e., draw lots or divide by means of headless arrows).
Who have made the Qur'an into fragments.
So, by your Lord, indeed We will definitely ask them all together.
Concerning whatever they were doing.
So profess openly what you have been commanded and veer away from the associators (Those who associate others with Allah)-
Surely We suffice you against the mockers-
Who make up with Allah another god; so they will eventually know.
And indeed We already know that, for you, your breast straitens by what they say.
So extol with the praise of your Lord and be of the prostrating.
And worship your Lord until the Certitude comes up to you.
