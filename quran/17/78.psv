Of what do they ask one another (questions)?
Of the tremendous tidings, (The Arabic word is singular).
Concerning which they (continue) differing among themselves.
Not at all! They will soon know!
Thereafter, not at all! They will soon know!
Have We not made the earth as a cradling, (Or: level lands).
And the mountains as bulwarks?
And We created you in pairs,
And We have made your sleep for repose,
And We have made the night for a garment,
And We have made the daytime for (earning) a livelihood.
And We have built above you seven strong (heavens),
And We have made a glowing luminary.
And We have sent down from the clouds (i.e., rain clouds) pressing forth water cascading.
That We may bring out thereby grain and growth,
And gardens entwined.
Surely the Day of Verdict has been (set) as a fixed time,
The Day when the Trumpet will be blown; then you will come up in troops,
And the heaven is opened, (and) so has become gates,
And the mountains are made to travel, (and) so have become a mirage.
Surely Hell has been observing, (i.e., in expectation of the criminals).
For the inordinate (as) a resorting,
Lingering therein for epochs.
They will not taste therein either coolness or any drink.
Except scalding water and (overflowing) pus,
An agreeable recompense.
Surely they did not hope for a reckoning,
And they cried lies to Our signs with constant cries (of lies).
And everything We have enumerated in a Book.
"So taste! We will never increase you in anything except in torment."
Surely for the pious there is a place of triumph,
Enclosed orchards, and vineyards,
And youthful virgins, like of age,
And a cup brimful.
Therein they will hear no idle talk nor cry of lies.
(It is for) recompense from your Lord, a gift, a reckoning,
(From) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, The All-Merciful; they possess (no power) of addressing Him.
On the Day when the Spirit and the Angels rise up in ranks, they will not speak, except him (to) whom The All-Merciful has given permission and who speaks (Literally: says) right.
That is the True Day. So whoever decides, should seek a resorting to his Lord (i.e., by doing righteous deeds).
Surely We have warned you of a near torment on the Day when a person will look at whatever his hands have forwarded, and the disbeliever will say, "Oh, would that I were dust!"
