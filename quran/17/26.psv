Ta, Sin, Mim. (These are the names of letters of Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here)
Those (Literally: that). are the Ã‰ayat (Verses, signs) of the evident Book.
You would possibly consume yourself that they are not believers.
In case We (so) decide, We will be sending down on them from the heaven a sign so their necks linger subdued to it.
And in no way does a recent Remembrance come up to them from The All-Merciful except they are veering away from it.
Then they have readily cried lies; so the tidings will soon come up to them of what they used to mock at.
And have they not regarded the earth, how many therein We have caused to grow of every honorable pair?.
Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
And as your Lord called out to Musa, (Moses) (saying), "Come up to the unjust people,
The people of Firaawn. (Pharaoh) Will they not be pious?"
He said, "Lord! Surely I fear they will cry me lies,
And my breast will be straitened, and my tongue will not be free. (i.e., it will not express well; literally, will not go off freely) So send to Harun. (Aaron).
And they have a guilty deed against me; so I fear they will kill me."
Said He, "Not at all, so go (both of you) with Our signs; surely We will be with you, listening.
So come up to Firaawn, then say (to him), "We (both) are the Messenger of The Lord of the worlds;
(Saying) Send forth with us the Seeds (Or: sons) of ." Israel)
Said he, "Did we not rear you among us as a newborn, and did you not linger among us years of your age?
And you performed the performance you performed and you were one of the disbelievers."
He (Musa) (Moses) said, "lo, I performed it and I was of the erring.
So I fled from you as soon as I feared you. Then my Lord bestowed upon me judgment and He made me one of the Emissaries.
And is that a favor you oblige me with, that you have taken the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel) as slaves."
Firaawn (Pharaoh) said, "And what is The Lord of the worlds."
He said, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them (both), in case you have certitude."
He said to the ones around him, "Do you not listen."
He said, "Your Lord and The Lord of your earliest fathers."
He said, "Surely your Messenger who has been sent to you is indeed a madman."
He said, "The Lord of the east and the west and whatever is between them (both), in case you (can) consider."
He said, "Indeed in case you take to yourself a god other than me, indeed I will definitely make you one of the imprisoned."
He said, "Even if I come to you with (some) thing evident?"
He said, "Come up with it then, in case you are of the sincere ones."
So he cast his staff, then, only then was it a (demonstrably) evident serpent.
And he drew out his hand, then, only then was it white to the onlookers.
He (Firaawn) said to the chiefs around him, "Surely this is indeed a knowledgeable sorcerer.
Who would like to drive you out of your land by his sorcery; so what do you command?"
They said, "Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send forth into the cities musterers,
Who will come up to you with every crafty, knowledgeable sorcerer."
So the sorcerers were gathered (together) for the fixed time on a known day. (A day of festival)
And it was said to the citizens, "Will you be gathered (together).
That possibly we would closely follow the sorcerers, in case they are the ones who are the overcomers?"
Then, when the sorcerers came, they said to Firaawn, (Pharaoh) "will we surely have a reward indeed, in case we are the ones who are the overcomers?"
He said, "Yes, and lo indeed, surely you will be indeed among the near-stationed."
Musa (Moses) said to them, "Cast you down whatever you will be casting."
So they cast down their ropes and their staffs and said, "By the might of Firaawn, we, surely we, will indeed be the overcomers."
Then Musa cast down his staff, then, only then did it gulp whatever falshood they (showed).
So the sorcerers were cast down, prostrating themselves.
They said, "We believe in The Lord of the worlds,
The Lord of Musa and Harun." (Aaron).
He (Firaawn) said, "You have believed him before I give you permission. Surely he is indeed your great (master) who taught you sorcery. Yet indeed you will eventually know! Indeed I will definitely cut off (The form of the verb implies something done repeatedly, or to a high degree or great extent. (cf. surat yusuf 3 1) your hands and legs alternately, and indeed I will definitely crucify you all together."
They said, "It is no trouble; surely to our Lord we are turning back. (Literally: turning over)
Surely we long for (the fact) that our Lord should forgive us our sins, for that we are the first of the believers."
And We revealed to Musa, (saying), "Set forth with My bondmen by night. Surely you will be closely followed."
Then Firaawn sent among the cities musterers.
"Surely these are indeed a gang of a few (persons),
And surely they are indeed enraging us,
And surely we are indeed all wary."
So We drove them out of gardens, and springs,
And hoardings, and an honorable station.
Thus, We gave them as an inheritance to the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel).
So they (Firaawn) (Pharaoh) and his hosts) followed them up at sunshine. (Or: going East)
Then, as soon as the two gatherings sighted each other, the companions of Musa (Moses) said, "Surely we are indeed overtaken!"
He said, "Not at all. Surely my Lord is with me; He will soon guide me."
Then We revealed to Musa, (saying), "Strike with your staff the sea." So it split, and each (separate) part was as a tremendous towering mountain.
And We drew forward the others there.
And We delivered Musa and the ones with him all together.
Thereafter We drowned the others.
Surely in that is indeed a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
And recite to them the tiding ofIbrahim, (Abraham).
As he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?
They said, "We worship idols, so we linger on consecrating (ourselves) to them."
He said, "Do they hear you as you invoke (them)?
Or do they profit you or harm (you)?"
They said, "No indeed, (but) we found our fathers thus performing."
He said, "Have you then seen what you have been worshiping, .
You and your fathers of old?
Yet, surely they are an enemy to me, except The Lord of the worlds.
Who created me. And so He, Ever He, guides me.
And (it is He) Who, Ever He, feeds me and He gives me to drink;
And when I am sick, then He, Ever He, cures me;
And (it is He) Who makes me to die; thereafter He gives me life.
And Whom I long (that) He will forgive me my offense (s) on the Day of Doom. (Or: Judgment)
My Lord! Bestow upon me judgment, and join me with the righteous,
And make for me a tongue of sincerity (Truthfulness) in the later (generations).
And make me among the heirs of the Garden of Bliss.
And forgive my father; surely he is one of the erring.
And do not disgrace me the Day when they are made to rise (again),
The Day when neither money nor sons will profit (anyone),
Except for him who comes up to Allah with a sound heart."
And the Garden will be drawn forward for the pious,
And Hell Fire will be brought forth for the misguided,
And it will be said to them, "Where is that which you used to worship.
Apart from Allah? Do they vindicate you or vindicate themselves?"
Then they will be pitched (headlong) into it, they and the misguided,
And the hosts ofIblis, all together.
They will say, (as) they stood therein, adversaries with each other,
"By Allah, decidedly we were indeed in evident error,
As we made you equal with The Lord of the worlds.
And in no way did anybody lead us into error except the criminals.
So (now) in no way do we have any intercessors,
Nor any intimate friend.
So, if we had (a chance) to recur, (i.e., to live again) then we should be among the believers!"
Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
The people of Nuh (Noah) cried lies to the Emissaries,
As their brother Nuh said to them, "Will you not be pious?
Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me."
They said, "should we believe you, and the most decrepit closely follow you?"
He said, "What knowledge have I of whatever they were doing?
Decidedly their reckoning (falls) upon no one except my Lord, if you are aware.
And in no way would I drive away the believers.
Decidedly I am nothing except an evident warner."
They said, "Indeed, decidedly in case you do not refrain, O Nuh, (Noah) indeed you will definitely be one of the stoned."
He said, "Lord! Surely my people have cried me lies,
So arbitrate between me and them a (conclusive) arbitration, and deliver me safely and the ones who are with me of the believers."
So We delivered him, and the ones with him, in the laden ship.
Thereafter We drowned afterwords the remaining ones.
Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
Aad cried lies to the Emissaries,
As their brother H?d said to them, "Will you not be pious?
Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds.
Do you build on every prominence a sign, sporting? (i.e., huge prominence inspiring fear)
And do you take to yourselves castles (Or: huge buildings and tombs) that possibly you may abide eternally?
And when you assault, you assault as potentates.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And be pious to Him Who has supplied you with whatever you know.
He has supplied you with cattle (Ancam includes cattle, camels, sheep, and goats) and sons,
And gardens and springs.
Surely I fear for you the torment of a tremendous Day."
They said, "It is equal to us, whether you admonish or you are not one of the admonishers.
Decidedly this is nothing except the character of the earliest (people),
And in no way will we be tormented."
So they cried him lies, then We caused them to perish. Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers,
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
Thamud cried lies to the Emissaries,
As their brother Salih said to them, "Will you not be pious?
Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds.
Will you be left secure in what you have here now,
In gardens and springs,
And plantations, and palm trees with spathes slender (and) digestible? (Or: heavy spthes)
And you (skillfully) hew houses out of the mountains?
So be pious to Allah, and obey me,
And do not obey the command of the extravagant.
Who corrupt in the earth, and do not act righteously."
They said, "Surely you are only one of the utterly bewitched.
In no way are you (anything) except a mortal, like us. Then come up with a sign, in case you are one of the sincere."
He said, "This is a she-camel. To her is a (time of) drinking and to you (another time of) drinking, on a known day.
And do not touch her with an odious (treatment) so that there takes you (away) the torment of a Tremendous Day."
Yet they hamstrung her, (and) so they became remorseful.
Then the torment took them (away). Surely in that is indeed a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
The people of Lut (Lot) cried lies to the Emissaries,
As their brother L?t said to them, "Will you not be pious?
Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds.
Do you come up to (stout) males of the worlds.
And leave behind what your Lord created for you as spouses? No indeed, (but) you are an aggressive people."
They said, "Indeed in case you do not refrain, O L?t, indeed you will definitely be of the driven out."
He said, "Surely I am of the disfavorers of your doing. (i.e., idisapprove of what you are doing)
Lord! Deliver me safely and my family from whatever they do."
So We delivered him safely and his family all together,
Except an old woman among the laggards.
Thereafter We destroyed the others.
And We rained on them a rain, so odious is the rain of them that are warned.
Surely in that is indeed a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
The companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Thicket cried lies to the Emissaries,
As Shuaayb said to them, "Will you not be pious?
Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger.
So be pious to Allah, and obey me.
And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds.
Fill up the measure, and do not be of them who make others losers.
And weigh with the straight equitableness,
And do not depreciate for mankind (the value) of their things, (i.e., their goods) and do not perpetrate (mischief) in the earth (as) corruptors.
And be pious to Him Who created you and the earliest crowds."
They said, "Surely you are only one of the utterly bewitched.
And in no way are you (anything) except a mortal, like us, and decidedly we surmise that you are indeed one of the liars.
So let fall down on us lumps from the heaven, in case you are of the sincere."
He said, "My Lord knows best whatever you do."
Yet they cried him lies; then the torment of the Day of the Overshadowing took them (away); surely it was the torment of a Tremendous Day.
Surely in that is indeed a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
And surely it is indeed the (successive) sending down of The Lord of the worlds.
The trustworthy Spirit has come down with it.
Upon your heart, that you may be one of the constant warners,
In an evident, Arabic tongue.
And surely it is indeed in the Scriptures (Literally: Zubur, i.e. the Psalms) of the earliest (people).
And was it not a sign for them, that it is known to the men of knowledge of the Seeds (Or: sons) of ? Israel)
And if We had been sending it down on some non-Arabs,
Then he had read to them, in no way would they have been believers in it.
Thus We have inserted it into the hearts of the criminals.
They (will) not believe in it until they see the painful torment,
So that it will come up to them suddenly, and they are not aware.
Then they will say, "will we be respited?"
So, do they seek to hasten Our torment?
Then, have you seen, in case We give them enjoyment for (many) years,
Thereafter (there) comes to them what they have been promised,
In no way will avail them whatever they had been given to enjoy.
And in no way did We cause (any) town to perish except that it had warners.
For a Reminding, and in no way have We been unjust.
And in no way have Ash-Shayatin (The ever-Vicious (ones), i.e., the devils) been coming down with it;
And in no way does it behoove them, And in no way are they able to do (that).
Surely they are indeed kept apart from hearing.
So do not invoke another god with Allah, then you should be of the tormented.
And warn your kinsmen, the nearest kin,
And lower your wing to the ones who closely follow you of the believers.
Yet, in case they disobey you, then say, "Surely I am quit of whatever you do."
And put your trust in The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.,
Who sees you while you rise (in prayer).
And (Ever) your turning about among the prostrate.
Surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Hearing, The Ever-Knowing.
Shall I (fully) inform you on whom Ash-Shayatin keep coming down?
They keep coming down on every most vicious (and) constant falsifier.
They are eager on hearing, and most of them are liars.
And the poets, the misguided closely follow them;
Have you not seen that they wander in every valley,
And that they say what they do not perform?
Excepting the ones who have believed, and done deeds of righteousness, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves ever after being unjustly treated. And soon the ones who did injustice will know by whatever overturning they will be overturned.
