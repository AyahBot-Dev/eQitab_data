And (by) the Star when it tumbles down.
In no way has your companion (The Prophet) erred, and in no way is he misguided.
And in no way does he pronounce (any word) out of prejudice.
Decidedly it is nothing except a revelation revealed.
One of valiant powers has taught him.
Owner of resolute splendor; (Literally: ability to transform; to convey revelation, i.e. Jibril "Angle Gabriel) so he leveled himself.
(When) he was on the most exalted horizon.
Thereafter he (came) within reach, then hung suspended,
So he was at two bows (distance) or (even) closer (still).
Then He Allah) revealed to His bondman what He revealed.
In no way did the heart-sight lie (about) what it saw.
Will you then wrangle with him about what he sees?
And indeed he did already see him (during) another descent,
At the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary.
At it is the Garden of the Abode.
As that which envelops did envelop the Lote-Tree.
In no way did (his) beholding (i.e., the eyesight) swerve, and in no way was it inordinate.
Indeed he has already seen of the signs of his Lord, the greatest.
Have you then seen Al-Lat and Al- cUzza,
And Manat, (These are the names of idols) the third, the other?
Do you have the male (s) and He the female (s)?
Lo, that were (really) a division most unreasonable.
Decidedly they are nothing except names you have named, you and your fathers. In no way has Allah sent down concerning them any all-binding authority. Decidedly they closely follow nothing except surmise and what (prejudices) the selves yearn to; and indeed the guidance has already come to them from their Lord.
Or even should man have whatever he covets?
Yet, to Allah belongs the Hereafter, and the First (life).
And how many an Angel (there is) in the heavens whose intercession does not avail anything except even after Allah gives permission to whomever He decides and He is satisfied.
Surely the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter do indeed name the Angels with female naming.
And in no way do they have any knowledge thereof. Decidedly they closely follow (nothing) except surmise, and surely surmise does not avail anything against the Truth.
So veer away from him who turns back from Our Remembrance and is not willing (to seek anything) except the present life (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world).
That is their attainment of knowledge. Surely your Lord is He Who knows best the ones who have erred away from His way, and He knows best the ones who are guided.
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that He may recompense the ones who have done odious (deeds) for what they have done and recompense the ones who have done fair (deeds) with the fairest reward,
The ones who avoid the great (kinds) of vice and obscenities, except lesser offences; surely your Lord is Ever-Embracing in (His) forgiveness. He knows you best, as He brought you into being from the earth, and as you were embryos in your mothers' bellies; so do not (consider) yourselves cleansed; (only) He knows best him who is pious.
Have you (The Prophet) then seen him who turns away.
And gives little and (then) parsimoniously?
Does he have in his presence the knowledge of the Unseen, so he sees?
Or even has he not been fully informed of what is in the Scrolls of Musa (Moses).
And Ibrahim, (Abraham) who constantly fulfilled the Message:
That no encumbered self will be encumbered with the encumbrance of another;
And that man will have nothing except that for which he has endeavored (to achieve);
And that his endeavor will eventually be seen;
(And) thereafter he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense;
And that to your Lord is the final (End); (Or: judgment; recompense).
And that He, Ever He, makes to laugh, and He makes to weep;
And that He Ever He, makes to die, and He makes to live;
And that He created the two pairs, the male and the female,
From a sperm drop when it is ejaculated;
And that upon Him (rests) the other engendering;
And that He, Ever He, enriches and gives property;
And that He, Ever He, is The Lord of Sirius; (Ash-Shicra, a star that was worshiped before Islam).
And that He caused to perish the earliest Aad,
And Thamud; so He did not spare (any of them);
And the people of Nuh (Noah) earlier; surely they were the ones who were more unjust and more inordinate.
And the City of Falsehood, He (also) made it sweep down,
So that (there) He constantly enveloped it whatever He constantly enveloped.
Then whichever of your Lord's boons do you wrangle about?
This is a Warner, of the earliest Warnings.
TheImminent is imminent;
Apart from Allah, none can lift it off.
Do you then wonder at this discourse,
And do you laugh, and do you not weep.
(While) you amuse yourselves?
So prostrate yourselves to Allah and worship (Him).A prostration is to be performed here
