Ha, Mim (These are the names of letters of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here).
And (by) the evident Book.
Surely We have sent it down in a blessed night; surely We have been warning.
Therein every Wise Command is distinctly (decreed),
(As) a Command from Our providence; surely We have (ever) been sending (Messengers).
As a mercy from your Lord; surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Hearing, The Ever-Knowing.
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them both, in case you are (believers) with certitude.
There is no god except He; He gives life and He makes to die; (He is) your Lord and The Lord of your earliest fathers.
No indeed, (but) they are in doubt, playing.
So be on the watch for a Day when the heaven will come up with an evident smoke,
That will envelop mankind; this is a painful torment.
"Our Lord, lift off from us the torment; surely, we are believers."
However could they have the Reminding, and an evident Messenger has already come to them,
(Yet) thereafter they turned away from him and said, "A man taught (by others), a madman!"
Surely We are lifting off the torment a little; surely you will be going back (to disbelief).
Upon the Day when We will assault you with the greatest assault; surely We will be Avengers.
And indeed already before them We tempted the people of Firaawn, (Pharaoh) and an honorable Messenger came to them. (Saying), "Discharge (Literally: give back to me) to me the bondmen of Allah; surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger."
And, "Do not exalt yourselves against Allah; surely I am bringing you an evident, all-binding authority;
And surely I take refuge in my Lord and your Lord that you should (not) stone me.
And in case you do not believe me, then keep apart from me!"
So he invoked his Lord, (saying)
"These are a criminal people."
"Then set forth with My bondmen by night, surely you will be closely followed.
And leave the sea becalmed; (Or: furrowed) surely they are a drowned host."
They left how many gardens and springs,
And plantations and how honorable a station,
And what comfort they used to (enjoy) cheerfully!
Thus (it was); and We made another people to inherit (these favors).
So, in no way did the heaven and the earth weep for them, and in no way were they respited.
And indeed We already safely delivered the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel) from degrading torment.
From Firaawn; (Pharaoh) surely he was exalted, of the extravagant.
And indeed We already chose them, out of a knowledge, over the worlds;
And We brought them (some) signs wherein there was an evident trial.
Surely these (people) are indeed saying,
"Decidedly there is nothing except our first death; and in no way will we be raised up.
Then come up with (i.e., bring) our fathers, in case you are sincere!"
Are they more charitable, (i.e., better) or the people of Tubbac and the ones even before them? We caused them to perish; surely they were criminals.
And in no way did We create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them both, playing;
In no way did We create them both except with The Truth; but most of them do not know.
Surely the Day of Verdict is their appointed time all together-
The Day a patronizer will not avail any patronized thing, and they will not be vindicated,
Except him on whom Allah has mercy; surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful.
Surely the Tree of ÉAz-Zaqqûm,
Is the food of the constantly vicious.
Like molten metal, it boils in the bellies,
As the boiling of scalding water.
"Take him, then thrust him into the (deepest) level of Hell-Fire;
Thereafter pour above his head of the torment of scalding (water)!
Taste! Surely you, (only) you are (i.e., you used to think that you were mighty) the constantly mighty, the constantly honorable!
Surely this is what you used to wrangle about."
Surely the pious will be in a station constantly secure,
In Gardens and Springs,
Wearing (garments) of serenest and brocade, facing one another.
Thus (it will be); and We will espouse them to wide-eyed h?r (Fair females in paradise).
Therein (they will be) calling for every (kind) of fruit, secure.
They will not taste therein of death, except the first death, and He will protect them from the torment of Hell-Fire,
A Grace from your Lord; that is it which is the magnificent triumph.
So We have surely made it easy by your tongue, only that possibly they would remind themselves.
Then be on the watch; surely they (too) are on the watch.
