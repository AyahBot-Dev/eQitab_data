Nun, (The is the name of a letter of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows its meaning here) and (by) the pen and what they inscribe,
In no way are you, by the favor of your Lord, a madman.
And surely you will have indeed a reward bountifully unfailing.
And surely you are indeed of a magnificent character.
So you will behold, and they will behold,
Whichever of you is the demented (The is the name of a letter of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows its meaning here).
Surely your Lord, He, Ever He, knows best the ones who have erred away from His way, and He Ever He, knows best the right-guided ones.
So do not obey the beliers.
They would like (if) you would dissimulate, then they would dissimulate.
And do not obey every most contemptible (person), constantly swearing,
Constantly slandering, ever-walking about with detraction,
Constant preventer of charity, constantly-vicious transgressor,
Coarse-grained, and of spurious parentage after all (Literally: after that)
For that he has (Literally: for that he owns) wealth and sons,
When Our ayat (Verses, signs) are recited to him, he says, "Myths of the earliest (people)."
We will (brand) him markedly upon the snout!
Surely We have tried them as We tried the companions (i.e., owners) of the garden, as they swore that indeed they would definitely wrest away (i.e., gather all) (its fruits) in the (early) morning,
And made no exception (for the Will of Allah).
Then a (destructive) visitation from your Lord visited (Literally: went around it) it while they were sleeping,
So (in the morning) it became as if it were a garden wrested away.
Then in the (early) morning they called out to one another,
(Saying), "Go forth early upon your tillage, in case you would wrest away (the fruit)!"
So they went off, speaking together in hushed voices,
(Saying), "Definitely no indigent person shall enter it today against you."
And they went forth early, determined on interdiction.
Then, as soon as they saw it, they said, "Surely we are indeed erring (people).
No indeed, (but) we are dispossessed!"
Said the most moderate of them, "Did I not say to you: Had you only extolled (Him)!"
They said, All Extolment be to our Lord! Surely we were unjust."
Then some of them came forward to others, blaming each other.
They said, "O woe to us! Surely we were inordinate.
It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a more charitable (i.e., better) one than it; surely to our Lord are we desirous (of His Grace)."
Thus was the torment; and the torment of the Hereafter is indeed greater, if they did know.
Surely for the pious will be the Gardens of Bliss in the Providence of their Lord.
Shall We then make the Muslims (Literally: the ones who have surrendered to Allah) like to the criminals?
What is it with you? How do you judge?
Or even do you have a Book wherein you study?
Surely therein you will have whatever you freely choose!
Or even do you have oaths from Us, reaching to the Day of the Resurrection? Surely you will have whatever you judge!
Ask them, whichever of them will assertively guarantee that!
Or even do they have associates (with Allah)? Then let them come up with their associates, in case they are sincere.
On the Day when the shank will be bared and they will be called to prostrate themselves, yet they are unable to.
Submissive will be their be holdings, (i.e., gazes) humbleness oppressing them. And they had been already called to prostrate themselves while (Literally: and) they were safe.
So leave Me (to deal) with him who cries lies to this discourse! We will soon draw them gradually (to punishment) from where they do not know,
And I will reprieve them. Surely My plotting is ever-pervading.
Or even do you ask them for a reward so they are weighed down with heavy fines?
Or even is the Unseen in their presence so they are writing (it down)?
So (endure) patiently under the Judgment of your Lord, and do not be as the Companion of the Whale (Prophet Yunus "Jonah") as he called out, as he (was) made to choke (inwardly).
Had there not overtaken him a favor from his Lord, indeed he would have been flung off upon the naked shore (i.e., the wilderness) (while) he was a reprobate.
Then his Lord selected him and so made him among the righteous.
And decidedly the ones who have disbelieved were indeed almost about to trip you with their be holdings as soon as they heard the Remembrance, and they say, "Surely he is indeed a madman."
And in no way is it anything except a Remembrance to the worlds.
