And (by) the emissaries in a (continual) series with benevolence,
Then (by) tempests (storming) tempestuously,
And (by) the spreaders spreading,
Then (by) the ones who separate with a (distinct) separation,
Then (by) the ones casting a Remembrance,
Excusing or warning,
Surely that which you are promised is indeed befalling!
So when the stars will be obliterated,
And when the heaven will be riven,
And when the mountains will be crushed,
And when the Messengers' (time) is fixed-
To whichever Day is (this) term appointed?
To the Day of Verdict.
And what makes you realize what the Day of Verdict is?
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
Did We not cause the earliest people to perish;
Thereafter We make the later generations follow them up?
Thus We perform against the criminals.
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
Did We not create you of a contemptible water,
Then We made it in an established reposing,
Till a known (term) determined?
So We determined; so Excellent the Determiners are We!
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
Have We not made the earth a receptacle.
For the living and the dead?
And We made therein lofty anchorages, (i.e., mountains) and We made you to drink water grateful (to taste).
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
Go off to what you used to cry as lies!
Go off to a three-pronged (Literally: comprising three prongs) shade.
With no plenteous shade and of no avail against the flames;
Surely it throws up sparks like palace (s) (Or: dry faggots).
As if they were yellow (heaps) of cables (Or: golden herds).
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
This is the Day they will not pronounce (a word),
Nor be permitted to, then excuse themselves.
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
This is the Day of Verdict: We have gathered you and the earliest (people);
So, if (ever) you have any plotting, then plot against Me!
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
Surely the pious will be in shades and springs,
And such fruits as they crave.
"Eat and drink, rejoicing with wholesome appetite, for whatever you were doing."
Thus surely We recompense the fair-doers.
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
"Eat and enjoy (your life) a little: surely you are criminals".
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
And when it is said to them, "Bow down!" They do not bow down.
Upon that Day woe to the beliers!
So, in whichever discourse after (this) do they believe?
