No! I swear by the Day of the Resurrection.
And no! I swear by the self, constantly self-blaming.
Does man reckon that We will never gather his bones?
Yes indeed, We are (always) Determiners over molding (again) his finger-tips.
No indeed, but man would (like) to act impiously in the (life) before him.
He asks, "When will be the Day of the Resurrection?"
Yet, when the sight (Literally: the beholding) is dazed,
And the moon eclipses, (Or: cave in).
And the sun and the moon are gathered together,
Upon that Day man will say, "Where to flee?" (Literally: Where is the fleeing?).
Not at all, no subterfuge!
To your Lord upon that day will be the repository!
Upon that Day man will be fully informed of whatever he forwarded and deferred.
No indeed, (but) man is a demonstration against himself,
Even though he cast forth his (ready) excuses.
Do not move your tongue with it (The Qur'an) to hasten on with it;
Surely upon Us is the gathering of it and its all-evident reading.
So when We have read it, then closely follow its all-evident reading.
Thereafter surely upon Us is its evident (exposition).
Not at all! No indeed, (but) you (i.e., mankind) love the hasty (world).
And leave behind the Hereafter.
Faces upon that Day will be blooming,
Looking towards their Lord;
And faces upon that Day shall be scowling,
Expecting that a (back-breaking) calamity is going to be performed upon them.
Not at all! When it reaches the clavicles,
And it is said, "Who is an enchanter?"
And he expects that it is the parting,
And shank is entwined with shank,
To your Lord upon that Day will be the driving.
So he neither sincerely (believed) nor prayed,
But he cried lies, and turned away;
Thereafter he went to his family striding haughtily.
(It is) more appropriate to you, then more appropriate! (i.e., punishment).
Thereafter (it is) more appropriate for you, then more appropriate!
Does man reckon that he will be left in vain?
Was he not a spermdrop ejaculated?
Thereafter he was a clot (i.e., a leach-like clot). So He created, then He molded,
So He made him of two spouses, the male and the female.
Is He (Literally: That) not (always) Determiner over giving life to the dead?
