And (by) the sun and its forenoon radiance,
And (by) the moon when it ensues it.
And (by) the daytime when it manifests it,
And (by) the night when it envelops it,
And (by) the heaven and That (i.e., The Command) which built it,
And (by) the earth and That (i.e., The Command) which spread it (even),
And (by) the self and That (i.e., The Command) which molded it,
So He inspired it to its impiety and piety!
He has already prospered who has cleansed it.
And he has already been disappointed who stunts it.
Thamud cried lies in their in ordinance,
As the most wretched of them deputed himself.
Then the Messenger of Allah said to them, "The she-camel of Allah! And (do not hinder) her drinking."
Yet they cried lies to him. So they hamstrung her; then their Lord devastated them for their guilty (deed), so He leveled it (i.e., destroyed the whole country).
And He does not fear its Ultimate Outcome.
