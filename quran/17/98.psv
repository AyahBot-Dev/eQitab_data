(The ones) who have disbelieved among the population of the Book (Or: family of the Book; i.e., the Jews and Christians) and the associators (Those who associate others with Allah) could not have left off (erring) until the Supreme Evidence came up to them-
A Messenger from Allah, reciting Scrolls purified,
Therein are ever-upright Books.
And in no way did the ones to whom the Book was brought (become) disunited, except ever after the Supreme Evidence came up to them.
And in no way were they commanded anything except to worship Allah, making the religion His faithfully (and) unswerving, and to keep up prayer, and bring the Zakat; (i.e., pay the poor-dues) and that is the Religion most upright.
Surely (the ones) who have disbelieved among the population of the Book (Or: family of the Book; i.e., the Jews and Christians) and the associators (Those who associate others with Allah) will be in the Fire of Hell, eternally (abiding) therein; those are they who are the most evil beings (Literally: Initiated creatures).
Surely (the ones) who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, those are they who are the most charitable (i.e., best) of beings.
Their recompense is with their Lord: Gardens of Adn (Eden) from beneath which rivers run, eternally (abiding) therein forever. Allah is satisfied with them, and they are satisfied with Him. That is for him who is apprehensive of his Lord.
