And (by) the forenoon,
And (by) the night when it (comes) with its dark stillness!
In no way has your Lord disregarded you, and in no way has He disfavored you.
And indeed the Hereafter will be more charitable (i.e., better) for you than the First (i.e., the present life).
And indeed your Lord will eventually give you so that you will be satisfied.
Did He not find you an orphan, so He gave (you) an abode,
And He found you erring, so He guided (you),
And He found you in want, so He enriched (you)?
Then, as for the orphan, then do not subdue (him),
And as for the beggar, then do not scold (him);
And as for your Lord's favor, then discourse about it! (i.e., proclaim it).
