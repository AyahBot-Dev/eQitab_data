Say, "I take refuge with The Lord of the Daybreak, (Literally: the Splitting "of the day").
From the evil of whatever He has created,
And from the evil of a dusky night when it overspreads (its gloom),
And from the evil of the women who spit on the knots, (i.e., perform malignant witchcraft).
And from the evil of an envier when he envies."
