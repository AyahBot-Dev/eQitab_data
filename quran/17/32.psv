Alif, Lam, Mim. (The are names of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here)
The successive sending down of the Book: there is no suspicion about it, from The Lord of the worlds.
Or even do they say, "He has fabricated it?" No indeed, (but) it is the Truth from your Lord, that you may warn a people; in no way did (any) warner come up to them even before you, that possibly they would be guided.
Allah is (The One) Who created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them in six days; thereafter He leveled Himself upon the Throne. (How He did so is beyond human understanding) In no way do you have, apart from Him, any patron nor any intercessor. Will you then not remind yourselves?
He conducts the Command from the heaven to the earth; thereafter it winds up (i.e., to ascend with difficalty) to Him in (one) Day, whose determined (length) is a thousand years of what you number.
That is (He), The Knower of the Unseen and the Witnessed, The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful,
Who perfected in the fairest (shape) everything He created; and He began the creation of man of clay.
Thereafter He made his progeny of an extraction of contemptible water;
Thereafter He molded him and breathed into him of His Spirit; and He made for you hearing, and beholding (s) (i.e., eyesight) and heart-sights; (i.e., perception) little do you thank (Him).
And they have said, "When we have erred away (i.e., lost our way; are dead) in the earth, will we surely be in a new creation indeed?" No indeed, (but) they are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.
Say, "The Angel of Death who has been entrusted with you will take you up; thereafter to your Lord you will be returned."
And if you could see the criminals protruding their heads in the Reckoning with their Lord, (saying), "Our Lord, we have beheld and heard; so return us, that we may do righteousness. (Now) surely we have certitude."
And if We had so decided, indeed We could have brought every self its guidance; but (now) the Saying from Me has come true: "Indeed I will definitely fill Hell with jinn (creatures) and mankind all together."
So taste for that you forgot the meeting of this your Day! Surely We have forgotten you. And taste the torment of eternity for whatever you were doing."
Surely only they believe in Our signs who, when they are reminded of them, collapse constantly prostrating and extol with the praise of their Lord, and they do not wax proud.* A prostration is to be performed here.
Their sides often shun (their) recumbencies (i.e., beds, places for reclining) to invoke their Lord in fear and in longing (from Him); and they expend of what We have provided them.
So no self knows what is (kept) concealed for them in comfort of the eyes as a recompense for whatever they were doing.
So, is he who has been a believer like him who has been immoral? They are not equal.
As for the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, then for them are the Gardens of Abode as quarters for whatever they were doing.
And as for the ones who have been immoral, then their abode will be the Fire. Whenever they would (like) to go out of it, they will be brought back into it, and it will be said to them, "Taste the torment of the Fire, which you used to cry lies to."
And We will indeed let them definitely taste of the lowlier torment, (i.e., Punishment in this life) lesser (Or: other than) than the greater, that possibly they would return.
And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the signs of his Lord, thereafter veers away from them? Surely We will be the Avengers against (Literally: avenge (Ourselves) the criminals.
And indeed, We already brought Musa (Moses) the Book; so do not go into wrangling (This is addressed is the Prophet) about receiving it; and We made it for a guidance to the Seeds (Or: sons) of . Israel)
And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our Command, since they (endured) patiently and had certitude in Our signs.
Surely your Lord is He Who will distinguish between them on the Day of the Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.
And is it not a guidance for them, (i.e., Does not (Punishment) guide them?) how many generations We caused to perish even before them, in whose dwellings they walk? Surely in that are indeed signs; will they not then hear?
And have they not seen that We drive the water to the arid land, so We bring out plantation therewith with which their cattle (ÉAncam includes cattle, camels, sheep and goats) and themselves eat? Will they not then behold?"
And they say, "When will be this Conquest (of yours), in case you are sincere?"
Say, "On the Day of the Conquest the belief of the ones who have disbelieved will not profit them, and they will not be respited."
So veer away from them, and wait; surely they (too) are waiting.
