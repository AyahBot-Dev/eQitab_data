Woe to every persistent slanderer, persistent defamer,
Who has gathered wealth and counted it over.
He reckons that his wealth has made him eternal!
Not at all! Indeed he will definitely be flung off into the Crusher.
And what makes you realize what the Crusher is?
(It is) the Fire of Allah kindled,
Which views the heart-sights.
Surely it is vaulted over (i.e., with no outlet) upon them,
In pillars widely extended.
