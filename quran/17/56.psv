When the Event (Literally: the Befalling) befalls,
There is no lying about its befalling;
Lowering (some), raising (others)
When the earth will be convulsed with a (severe) convulsion,
And the mountains crumbled with a violent crumbling,
So that they become disseminated dust particles,
And you will be three pairs,
So (as for) the companions of the Rightness, (Or: the Right Hand) what (will become) of the companions of the Rightness?
And the companions of the Sinister (befalling), what (will become) of the companions of the Sinister (befalling)? (Or: the Left Hand)
And the Outstrippers, (i.e., those who precede others) the Outstrippers-
Those are the ones to be brought near (in the Hereafter).
In the Gardens of Bliss-
A throng of the earliest (people),
And a few of the latest (people),
Upon close-wrought (Or: plaited or encrusted) settees,
Reclining upon them, facing one another.
(There) go round them eternalized young men.
With goblets, and beakers, and a cup from a profuse spring,
Wherefrom their (heads) will not ache, nor will they feel exhausted,
And (such) fruits as they will freely choose,
And such flesh of birds as they crave for,
And wide-eyed huris,
As the likeness of nestled pearls.
(This is) a recompense for whatever they were doing.
Therein they will not hear any idle talk, nor any cause for vice,
Except the blissful saying, "Peace! Peace!"
And the companions of the Right; what (will become) of the companions of the Right?
They will be among thornless lote-trees,
And Talh, (It may mean banana or acacia, which are compacted) tiered (one on another),
And extended shade,
And outpoured water,
And many (kinds) of fruit-
Neither out of season, (Literally: cut off) nor out of reach- (i.e., unending fruits, that are not forbidden).
And raised beddings.
Surely We have brought them (The huris) into being a (perfect) bringing up;
So We have made them virgins,
Chastely amorous, like of age,
For the companions of the Right-
A throng of the earliest (people, )
And a throng of the later (people).
And the companions of the Left, what (will become) of the companions of the Left?
(They will be) in pestilential wind, and scalding water,
And the shade of a Smoking Blaze,
Neither cool, nor refreshing (Literally: honorable).
Surely they were before that (living) in ease and luxury.
And they used to persist in the monstrous vileness;
And they used to say, "When we die and are dust and bones, will we surely be made to rise again?
And (also) our earliest fathers?"
Say, (This is addressed to the Prophet) "Surely the earliest people and the later.
Will indeed be gathered to the fixed time of a known Day.
Thereafter, surely you, you erring ones, the beliers,
Indeed you will eat of the trees of Zaqqum;
So you will be filling therewith (your) bellies.
Then you will be drinking thereon of scalding water;
So you will be drinking (like) the drinking of diseased camels wandering with thirst."
This is their hospitality on the Day of Doom.
We, Ever We, created you. Would you then sincerely admit (the Truth)?
So, have you then seen what you ejaculate?
Is it you who create it, or even are We the Creators?
We, Ever We, have determined among you Death; and in no way are We, Ever We, outstripped,
(So) that We may exchange the likes of you and bring you into being (again in a fashion) you do not know.
And indeed you have already known the earliest bringing into being; (if) had you (known), you would have been mindful!
Have you then seen (whatever) you till?
Is it you who plant it or are We, Ever We, the Planters?
If We had (so) decided We would indeed have made it crushed to pieces; then you would linger on (bitterly) exclaiming,
"Surely we are indeed penalized (for debt);
No indeed, (but) we are dispossessed!"
Have you then seen the water you drink?
Is it you who have sent it down from the rainy clouds or are We, Ever We, The Senders down?
If We had (so) decided, We would have made it bitter; so had you only thanked (Us)!
Have you then seen the fire you flare up?
Is it you who brought its tree into being, or are We, Ever We, The Bringers into being?
We, Ever We, have made it for a Reminder and an enjoyment for the denizens in the desert.
So extol with the Name of your Lord, The Ever-Magnificent!
Then no! I swear by the sites of the stars-
And surely it is indeed a tremendous oath, if you only know (it)-
Surely it is indeed an honorable Qur'an,
In a nestled Book,
Which none shall touch except the purified,
A successive sending down from The Lord of the worlds.
Is it, then, that you (i.e., the disbelievers) are dissimulating with this Discourse?
And making your provision (for livelihood) that you cry lies?
Then had it been that, when (the self) (i.e., the self of the dying person) reaches the gullet (of the dying)-
And you at that while of time (sit) looking on,
And We are nearer to him than you, but you do not behold-
Then had you been (sure) that, in case you are other than being doomed,
Make it return, if (ever) you are sincere?
So, as for him who in case he is of those brought near (to Us),
Then (there will be) relief, and soothing comfort, and a Garden of Bliss;
And as for him who in case he is of the companions of the Right,
Then (it will be said), "Peace be upon you; (you are) one of the companions of the Right."
And as for him who in case he is of the beliers (and) the erring,
Then (there will be) hospitality of scalding (water)
And the roasting in Hell-Fire.
Surely this is indeed the very Truth of Certitude.
So extol with the Name of your Ever- Magnificent Lord?
