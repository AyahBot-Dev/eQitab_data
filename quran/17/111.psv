Would the hands of Ã‰Abu Lahab be cut up, (i.e., perish) and would he be cut up (too)!
In no way did his wealth avail him, neither whatever he earned;
He will roast at a flaming Fire, (Literally: fire comprising flame).
And his wife, the constant bearer of firewood,
Upon her (long) neck she will have a rope of palm-fibers.
