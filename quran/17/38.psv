Sad (This is name of a letter of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows its meaning here) and (by) the Qur'an comprising the Remembrance.
No indeed, (but) the ones who have disbelieved are in might and opposition.
How many a generation We caused to perish even before them, yet they called out, while time had lapsed for shirking (their doom).
And they wonder that a warner has come to them from among them, and the disbelievers have said, "This is a sorcerer, a (great) liar."
Has he made the gods one God? Surely this is indeed a most wondrous thing."
And the chiefs among them went off, (saying), "Go on! (Or: March on!) And endure (patiently) with your gods; surely this indeed is a thing willfully (designed).
In no way did we hear of this in the last creed; decidedly this is nothing except a made-up device.
Has the Remembrance been sent down on him from among us?" No indeed, (but) they are in doubt of My Remembrance; no indeed (but) they have not as yet tasted My torment.
Or even do they have in their presence the treasuries of your Lord's mercy, The Ever-Mighty, Superb Bestower?
Or even does the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them belong to them? Then let them ascend the means!
A very host of the (allied) parties is routed from these.
The people of Nuh, (Noah) and c?d, and Firaawn, (Pharaoh) owner of the bulwarks, cried lies before them.
And Thamud, and the people of Lut (Lot) and the companions of the Thicket; those were the (allied) parties.
Decidedly not one but cried lies to the Messengers, so My punishment came true.
And in no way are these looking for anything except one Shout; in no way is there any recovery from it.
And they have said, "Our Lord, hasten (quickly) to us our sentence before the Day of Reckoning."
(Endure) patiently what they say; and remember Our bondman Dawud (David) (a man) possessing prowess (Literally: hands). Surely he was a constant resorter (to Allah).
Surely to him We subjected the mountains with him to extol at nightfall and sunshine.
And the birds, mustered all to him a constant resorter.
And We upheld his kingdom and brought him (the) Wisdom and decisive speech (Literally: the verdict, the address).
And has the tiding of the adversaries come up to you? As they scaled the chamber,
As they entered upon Dawud; then he was alarmed of them. They said, "Do not fear (anything); two adversaries we are. One of us has been inequitable to the other, (Literally: some of us against some "others") so judge between us with the truth, and do not act unjudiciously, and guide us to the level path.
Surely this my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe. So he said to me, Let me be her sponsor' and he got the better of me in speech." (Literally: was mightier in the address)
He (Dawud) said, "Indeed he has already done an injustice to you in asking for your ewe (in addition) to his ewes; and surely many intermixes are indeed inequitable one against the other, (Literally: some of them are unfair to some "others") except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, and how few they are!" And Dawud surmised that We had only tempted (Or: tried) him; so he asked forgiveness of his Lord, and he collapsed bowing down and turned penitent. A prostration is to be performed here.
So We forgave him that, and surely he has in Our Providence proximity indeed and a fair resorting.
O Dawud, surely We have made you a succeeding (Literally: Caliph) (Messenger) in the earth, so judge among mankind with the truth, and do not ever follow prejudice that it may make you err from the way of Allah. Surely the ones who err from the way of Allah will have a strict torment for that they have forgotten the Day of Reckoning.
And in no way have We created the heaven and the earth and whatever is between them untruthfully. That is the surmise of the ones who have disbelieved. So woe to the ones who have disbelieved, from the Fire!
Or even shall We make the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness as the corruptors in the earth, or even shall We make the pious as the constantly impious?
A Book We have sent down to you, Blessed, that they may ponder over its ayat (Verses, signs) and that men endowed with intellects would remind themselves.
And We bestowed on Dawud (David) Sulayman; (Solomon) how excellent a bondman he was! Surely he was a constant resorter (to Us).
As there were set (in parade) before him at nightfall light-footed (Literally: standing on three feet) coursers.
Then he said, "Surely I have loved the love of (earthly) charitable (things) better than the Remembrance of my Lord, " until (the sun) disappeared behind the curtain (Literally: made herself disappear with the curtain).
"Turn them back to me!" Then he took to striking (Or: slashing) their shanks and necks.
And indeed We already tempted Sulayman, (Solomon) and We cast upon his chair a corporeal (form); thereafter he turned penitent.
He said, "Lord! Forgive me, and bestow on me a kingdom such as may not behoove anyone even after me; surely You, Ever You, are The Superb Bestower."
So We subjected to him the wind, which ran at his command, gently where he would direct it light on,
And Ash-Shayatin, (The ever-vicious "one", i.e., the Devils) every skilled builder, and (expert) diver.
And others interlinked in fetters.
This is Our gift; so be bounteous or hold back without reckoning.
And surely he has indeed in Our Providence a near proximity and a fair resorting.
And remember Our bondman ÉAyyûb, (Job) as he called out to his Lord (saying), "Ash-Shaytan (The ever-vicious "one", i.e., the Devil) has touched me with calamity and torment."
"Scamper with your leg. This is a washing-place, cool and a drink."
And We bestowed on him his family, and the like of them with them, a mercy from Us, and a Reminding to ones endowed with intellects.
And (we said) "Take in your hand a jumble of rushes, then strike therewith, and do not break (your oath)." Surely We found him a patient (man). How excellent a bondman he was! Surely he was a constant resorter (to Us).
And remember Our bondmen Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaaqub, (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively) (men) endowed with achievements and be holdings (Literally: with hands and eyesight"s").
Surely We made them faithful with the (exclusively sincere) faith, the Reminding of the Residence (i.e., the Hereafter)
And surely in Our Providence they are indeed of the elected, the most charitable (i.e., the best).
And remember Ismail, (Ishmael) and Alyasaca and Thalkifli; and each is among the most charitable.
This is a Remembrance; and surely for the pious is indeed a fair resorting.
Gardens of Adn (Eden) whereof the gates are open for them.
Reclining therein, they call for many fruits and (cool) drink therein.
And in their presence are (maidens) restraining their glances (and) like of age.
This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.
Surely this is indeed Our provision; in no way will it suffer depletion.
This is (for the righteous); and surely for the inordinate (i.e., tyrants) there will indeed be an evil resorting.
Hell, wherein they roast, miserable then is the cradling!
This is (their reward); so let them taste it: scalding (water) and constantly (overflowing) pus,
And other (torments) of like kind paired together.
This is a troop rushing along with you; there is no welcome for them; surely they will be roasting in the Fire.
They will say, "No indeed, it is you (who) have no welcome; you forwarded it for us; so, miserable is the reposing!"
They will say, "Our Lord, whoever forwarded this for us, then doubly increase torment for him in the Fire!"
And they will say, "How is it with us, (that) we do not see men (here) that we used to count among the evil (ones)?
Did we take them to ourselves as a (target of) scoffing? Or have our be holdings swerved away from them?"
Surely this is indeed true: the adversaries among the population (Or: the family) of the Fire.
Say, "Surely I am only a warner; and in no way is there any god except Allah, The One, The Superb Vanquisher.
The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, The Ever-Mighty, The Superb Forgiver.
Say, (This is addressed to the Prophet) "It is a magnificent tiding.
From which you are veering away.
In no way did I have any knowledge of the most exalted Chiefs (of the Angels) as they took adversary stands (among themselves).
Decidedly nothing is revealed to me except that surely I am only an evident constant warner."
(Remember) as your Lord said to the Angels, "Surely I am creating a mortal of a clay.
So when I have molded him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall down to him prostrating!"
So the Angels prostrated themselves, all of them all together,
Except Iblis; he waxed proud, and was (one) of the disbelievers.
Said He, "O Iblis, what prevented you to prostrate yourself to what I created with My Hands? Have you waxed proud, or are you of the exalted?"
Said he, "I am more charitable (i.e., better) than he; You created me of fire, and him You created of clay."
Said He, "Then get (Literally: go out) out of it; so surely you are a constant outcast.
And surely My curse is on you till the Day of Doom." (i.e., Judgment).
Said he, "Lord! Respite me then to the Day (when) they are made to rise again."
Said He, "So, surely you are of the respited,
Until the Day of the known time."
Said he, "Then, by Your Might, indeed I will definitely misguide them all together,
Excepting Your bondmen among them that are most faithful (to You)."
Said He, "The Truth then is (this), and the Truth I say:
Indeed I will definitely fill Hell with you and with whoever of them follows you all together."
Say, (This is addressed to the Prophet) "In no way do I ask of you any reward, and in no way am I (one) of the pretenders.
Decidedly it (is nothing) except a Remembrance to the worlds.
And indeed you will definitely know its tiding after a while."
