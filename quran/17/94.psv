Have We not expanded your breast for you,
And laid aside from you your encumbrance.
Which weighed down your back,
And did We not raise for you your remembrance?
So surely with difficulty comes ease,
Surely with difficulty comes ease.
So when you are at leisure, (i.e., not o) then labor,
And to your Lord then be desirous (i.e., of His Grace).
