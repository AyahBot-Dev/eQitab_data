When the earth is quaked with its (final) earthquake,
And the earth brings out its heavy (burdens),
And man says, "What is it with it?"
Upon that Day it will discourse (i.e., proclaim) about its tidings.
That your Lord has revealed to it.
Upon that Day mankind will go forward in diverse (groups) to be shown their deeds.
So whoever does an atom's weight of charity will see it,
And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
