Surely We sent it down on the Night of Determination;
And what makes you realize what the Night of Determination is?
The Night of Determination is more charitable (i.e., better) than a thousand months.
The Angels and the Spirit keep coming down therein, by the permission of their Lord, with (Literally: from) every Command.
Peace it is, till the rising of the dawn.
