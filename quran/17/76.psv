Has there come upon man a while of (an) era when he was not a thing to be remembered?
Surely We created man from a sperm-drop, a mingling, trying him; so We made him constantly hearing, constantly beholding.
Surely We have guided him upon the way, whether he be thankful or most disbelieving.
Surely We have readied for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a Blaze.
Surely the benign will drink of a cup whose blend is camphor,
A spring whereat drink the bondmen of Allah, making it to gush forth with plenteous gushing (i.e., abundantly).
They fulfill (their) vows and fear a Day whose evil is spread all over;
And they give food (Literally: feed with food) for the love of Him, (Or: love of it) to the indigent, (and) the orphan, and the captive.
"Surely we feed you only for the Face of Allah. We would not have any recompense from you, nor thankfulness.
Surely we fear from our Lord a most frowning Day most inauspicious."
So, Allah has protected them from the evil of that Day and has granted (Literally: made them receive) them bloom and pleasure.
And He has recompensed them for (enduring) patiently with a Garden and silk.
Reclining therein upon couches, therein they will see neither sun nor bitter cold;
And the shades thereof will be close upon them, and its picked fruits brought meekly low with all meekness.
And there will be passed round for them vessels of silver and goblets that were (designed) of crystals,
Crystals of silver that they have determined its (measure), an exact determination.
And they are given to drink therein a cup whose blend is ginger.
Therein is a spring whose name is (called) Salsabil.
And eternalized all-young men go round them; when you see them, you reckon them as strewn pearls,
And when you see (them) hence, you see bliss and a great kingdom.
Their upper (covering) will be green clothes of sarcenet and brocade, and they are ornamented with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them to drink a drink most pure.
Surely (it will be said), "This is duly yours as a recompense, and your endeavor is (also) to be thanked."
Surely We, Ever We, have been sending down the Qur'an on you, a successive sending down.
So (endure) patiently under the Judgment of your Lord, and do not obey one of them, vicious or most disbelieving;
And remember the Name of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset.
And (part) of the night; so prostrate yourself to Him, and extol Him through the long night.
Surely these (people) love the hasty (world) and leave behind them a heavy Day.
We, Ever We, created them, and We have upheld their frames; and when We (so) decide, We will exchange their likes, an (easy) exchange.
Surely this is a Reminder; so whoever decides, (may) take (to himself) a way to his Lord.
And in no way can you (Literally: mankind) decide unless Allah (so) decides; surely Allah has been Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise.
He causes whomever He decides to enter into His mercy; and for the unjust (ones) He has prepared a painful torment.
