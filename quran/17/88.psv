Has the discourse of the Enveloper come up to you?
Faces upon that day will be submissive,
Laboring, toiling,
Roasting at a Fire burning hot.
Watered from a duly (Or: hot) (boiling) spring.
No food will be brought for them except from daric, (Or: cactus thorn).
Not to plum pen and of no avail against hunger.
(Other) faces upon that day will be blissful,
With their endeavor satisfied,
In an exalted Garden,
Therein they do not hear any idle (word).
Therein is a running spring,
Therein are upraised settees,
And goblets set forth,
And cushions ranged,
And carpets outspread.
Will they then not look at the camels, how they have been created,
And at the heaven, how it has been raised up,
And at the mountains, how they have been set up,
And at the earth, how it has been encrusted? (i.e., provided with a surface or crust).
So remind them! Surely you are only a constant Reminder;
You are not in any way a dominator over them,
Except for him who has turned away and disbelieved,
Then Allah will torment him with the greatest torment.
Surely, to Us is their coming back,
Thereafter surely upon Us is their reckoning.
