Extol The Name of your Lord, The Most Exalted,
Who created; so He molded;
And Who determined; so He guided;
And Who brought out the pasturage,
Then He made it a dark (Or: stubble including all pasturage) stubble.
We will soon make you read so you will not forget,
Excepting whatever Allah decides; surely He knows audible speech and what is concealed.
And We will ease you to the Easiest (way).
So remind, in case the Reminding profits.
He who is apprehensive will constantly remember,
And the most wretched will avoid it,
(He) who will roast in the Greatest Fire,
Thereafter he will neither die therein, nor live.
He has already prospered who has cleansed himself.
And who remembers the Name of his Lord, so he prays.
No indeed, (but) you prefer the present life, (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world).
And the Hereafter is more charitable (i.e., better) and more enduring.
Surely this is in the earliest Scrolls,
The Scrolls of Ibrahim and Musa (Abraham and Moses respectively).
