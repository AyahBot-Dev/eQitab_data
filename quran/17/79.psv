And (by) the pluckers drowning, (i.e., Angels plucking the disbelievers).
And (by) the brisk (angels acting) briskly,
And (by) the swimmers swimming (serenely), (Or: gliding; horses racing; celestial bodies racing).
Then (by) the outstrippers outstripping (smoothly),
Then (by) the directors (conducting) according to His Command.
On the Day when the (first) commotion commoves,
Followed by the subsequent (commotion),
Hearts upon that Day will be agitated,
Their beholdings (i.e., eyesights) will be submissive.
They will say, "will we surely be turned back to our former state? (Some interpret the Arabic to mean "in the grave" or "gravediggers").
Even when we are decayed bones?"
They will say, "Lo, that then would be a losing recurrence!"
Yet, surely it shall be only one scaring (Cry),
Then, only then, are they wakeful (for Judgment) (i.e. for Hell or watchful place).
Has there come up to you the discourse of Musu (Moses).
As his Lord called out to him in the supremely holy valley, Tuwa:
"Go to Firaawn; (Pharaoh) surely he has grown tyrannical (Or: inordinate).
So say (to him), Â‘Would you (be ready) to cleanse yourself,
And that I should guide you to your Lord, then you will be apprehensive of (Him)?"'
So he (Moses) showed him (Pharaoh) the greatest sign,
Yet he (Pharaoh) cried lies and disobeyed,
Thereafter he withdrew in a (hasty) endeavor.
So he mustered and called out,
Then he said, "I am your lord, most exalted!"
Then Allah took him (away) with the torture of the Hereafter and the First (life).
Surely in that is indeed a lesson for him who is apprehensive!
Are you harder in creation than the heaven? He built it!
He raised up its vault, then He molded it,
And He bedimmed its night and brought out its forenoon.
And the earth, after that He flattened it (for life).
There from He brought out its water, and its pasture.
And the mountains He made steady, (i.e., made them anchorages).
An enjoyment for you and your cattle.
So when the Greatest Catastrophe comes,
On the Day when man will remind himself (of) whatever he has endeavored (to achieve),
And Hell-Fire is brought forth for whoever sees,
Then, as for him who was inordinate.
And preferred the present life, (Literally: lowly life, i.e., the life of this world).
Then surely Hell-Fire will be the (only) abode.
And as for him who feared the station of his Lord (i.e., punishment from his lord) and forbade the self (its) prejudices,
Then surely the Garden will be the (only) abode.
They ask you about the Hour: when will it have its berthing? (Literally: anchorage; i.e., when will it be).
Wherein are you (concerned) with the Reminding of it?
To your Lord is the ultimate (knowledge) of it.
Surely you are only the warner of him who is apprehensive of it.
It will be as if, on the Day they see it, they have not lingered except for a nightfall or its forenoon.
