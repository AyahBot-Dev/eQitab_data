Qaf, (This is the name of a letter of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows its meaning here) and (by) the Ever-Glorious Qur'an!
No indeed, (but) they wonder that a warner has come to them from among them; then, the disbelievers say, "This is a wondrous thing!
When we die and are dust (will we return)? That is a far returning!"
We already know what the earth diminishes of them; and in Our Providence is a Book Ever-Preserving.
No indeed, (but) they cried lies to the Truth as soon as it came to them; so they are confused (Or: they are in a confused state) as regards the Command.
Have they not then looked at the heaven above them, how We have built it, and adorned it, and (how) in no way has it any rifts?
And the earth, We have extended and cast therein anchorages, (i.e., mountains) and We caused to grow in it of every delightful pair.
For a clear demonstration, and a Reminding for every penitent bondman.
And We have been sending down from the heaven water blessed; so We caused to grow thereby gardens and a grain of harvest,
And palm-trees aloft with spathes tiered.
A provision for the bondmen; and therewith We give life to a deceased country. Thus is the going out (of the graves).
Cried lies before them the people of Nûh, (Noah) and the companions of ÉAr-Rass, and Thamûd,
And Aad, and Firaawn, (Pharaoh) and the brothers of Lut, (Lot).
And the companions of the Thicket, and the people of Tubbac. Every one cried lies to the Messengers; so My threat came true.
Did We then falter by the first creation? No indeed, (but) they are in confoundedness as to a new creation.
And indeed We already created man, and We know whatever his self whispers within him, and We are nearer to him than the jugular vein.
As the two Receiver (Angels) receive, on the right (hand) and on the left (hand), constantly seated.
In no way does he utter a saying except that close to him is a (Guardian) constantly ready.
And the stupor of death comes with the Truth; that is what you were averting.
And the Trumpet is blown; that is the Day of the Threat.
And every self will come, (and) with it a driver and a constantly present witness.
"Indeed you were already in (a state of) heedlessness of this. Then (now) We have lifted off from you your covering; so your beholding today is very sharp." (Literally: iron "like")
And his comrade will say, "This is what is closely kept with me constantly ready."
"Cast, you both, in (to) Hell every stubborn, most disbelieving (one),
All) persistent preventers of charity, transgressors, (and the ones) causing suspicion,
Who set up with Allah another god; so cast him, you both, in (to) the strict torment."
His comrade will say, "Our Lord, in no way did I cause him to be inordinate; but he was in far error."
He Allah) will say, "Do not take adversary stands with each other close to Me; and I have already forwarded to you the threat.
In no way is the Saying exchanged close to Me; and in no way am I unjust to (My) slaves."
On the Day We will say to Hell, "Are you filled?" And it will say, "Is there any further increase?" (i.e., more to come).
And the Garden will be drawn forward for the pious, without being afar.
This is what you have been promised; it is for every one who is a constant reporter (to Allah) (and) a constant preserver (of the Command),
Who is apprehensive of The All-Merciful in the Unseen and comes with a penitent heart.
"Enter it in peace! That is the Day of Eternity."
Therein they will have whatever they decide on, and close to Us there is utmost increase.
And how many a generation We caused to perish before them (who) were more valiant in assault than they, so that they overran the lands; (yet) had they any evasion (from Us)?
Surely in that there is indeed a Reminding to him who has a heart, or is eager (Literally: cast "his" hearing) on hearing, and is a constantly present witness (to the Truth).
And indeed We already created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days, and in no way has any fatigue touched Us.
So (endure) patiently what they say and extol with the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting;
And in the night then extol (Him) and at the ends (Literally: at the rear) of prostrations.
And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a near place,
The Day (when) they hear the Shout with the Truth; that is the Day of going out (of the graves).
Surely We, Ever We, give life and make to die, and to Us is the Destiny.
The Day (when) the earth is cloven from above them as they (go forth) swiftly; that is a mustering easy for Us.
We know best whatever they say; and in no way are you a potentate over them. So remind by the Qur'an him who fears (My) threat.
