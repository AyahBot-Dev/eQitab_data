Indeed, We sent it [i.e., the Qur’ān] down during the Night of Decree.
And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree?
The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months.
The angels and the Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. 
Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.
