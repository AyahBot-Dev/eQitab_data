Say: "I seek refuge with (Allâh) the Lord of mankind, 
"The King of mankind - 
"TheIlâh(God) of mankind,
"From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one’s heart after one remembers Allâh). 
"Who whispers in the breasts of mankind.
"Of jinn and men."
