Verily, We have sent it (this Qur’ân) down in the night ofAl-Qadr(Decree). 
And what will make you know what the night ofAl-Qadr(Decree) is?
The night ofAl-Qadr(Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allâh in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and theRûh[Jibrîl (Gabrîl)] by Allâh’s Permission with all Decrees,
(All that night), there is Peace (and Goodness from Allâh to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.
