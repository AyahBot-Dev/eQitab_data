Have you seen him who denies the Recompense?
That is he who repulses the orphan (harshly),  
And urges not on the feeding ofAl-Miskîn(the poor),  
So woe unto those performers ofSalât(prayers) (hypocrites),
Those who delay theirSalât(prayer from their stated fixed times).
Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men),
And preventAl-Mâ‘ûn(small kindnesses like salt, sugar, water).
