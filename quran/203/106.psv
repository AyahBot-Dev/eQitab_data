(It is a great Grace from Allâh) for the protection of the Quraish,
(And with all those Allâh’s Grace and Protections, We cause) the (Quraish) caravans to set forth safe in winter (to the south) and in summer (to the north without any fear),
So let them worship (Allâh) the Lord of this House (theKa‘bahin Makkah),
(He) Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.
