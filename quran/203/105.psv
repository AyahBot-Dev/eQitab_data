Have you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant? [The Elephant army which came from Yemen under the command of Abrahah Al-Ashram intending to destroy theKa‘bahat Makkah].
Did He not make their plot go astray?
And He sent against them birds, in flocks,
Striking them with stones ofSijjîl(baked clay).
And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).
