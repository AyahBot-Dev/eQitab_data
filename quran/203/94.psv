Have We not opened your breast for you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)?
And removed from you your burden.
Which weighed down your back?
And have We not raised high your fame?
Verily, along with every hardship is relief,
Verily, along with every hardship is relief (i.e. there is one hardship with two reliefs, so one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs).
So when you have finished (your occupation), devote yourself for Allâh’s worship.
And to your Lord (Alone) turn (all your) intentions and hopes.
