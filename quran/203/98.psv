Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) andAl-Mushrikûn,  were not going to leave (their disbelief) until there came to them clear evidence.
A Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from Allâh, reciting (the Qur’ân) purified pages [purified fromAl-Bâtil(falsehood)].
Wherein are correct and straight laws from Allâh.
And the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) differed not until after there came to them clear evidence (i.e. Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and whatever was revealed to him).
And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and performAs-Salât(Iqâmat-as-Salât) and giveZakât, and that is the right religion.
Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islâm, the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) andAl-Mushrikûnwill abide in the Fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.  
Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures.
Their reward with their Lord is‘Adn(Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity), underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever, Allâh will be pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.
