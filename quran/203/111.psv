Perish the two hands of Abû Lahab (an uncle of the Prophet) and perish he!  
His wealth and his children will not benefit him!
He will be burnt in a Fire of blazing flames!
And his wife, too, who carries wood (thorns ofSa‘dânwhich she used to put on the way of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, or use to slander him).  
In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad (palm fibre).
