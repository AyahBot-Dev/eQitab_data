When there comes the Help of Allâh (to you, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah).
And you see that the people enter Allah’s religion (Islâm) in crowds.
So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His Forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.
