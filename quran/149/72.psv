Say  sg   , “It was revealed to me that a band of unseen beings  listened in and said, ‘Indeed, we have heard a wondrous Recital  
that guides to prudence, so we have come to believe in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord.
 And that    most high is the Grandeur of our Lord—He never took a female companion nor a child.
 And that   d   our fool used to speak untruthfully about Allah.
 And that    we thought that humans and unseen beings would never  say     a lie about Allah.
 And that   d   certain men among humans used to seek refuge in certain men among the unseen beings, but they only increased them in confusion.
 And that   a   they thought, as you  pl   thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone.
 And that   a   we sought to reach the heaven and found it filled with stern guards and meteors.
 And that   a   we used to take up positions to listen in, but whoever listens now finds a meteor in wait for him.
 And that   a   we do not know whether ill has been desired for those on earth, or if their Lord has desired prudence for them.
 And that   a   some of us are righteous, but some of us are less than that: we have been following divergent roads.
 And that    we realized that we cannot thwart Allah on earth, nor can we thwart Him by fleeing.
 And that   a   when we heard the guidance we believed in it, for whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss nor confusion.
 And that   a   among us are Muslims  and among us are those who swerve from justice, so whoever has become Muslim—it is they who have pursued prudence.
But as for those who swerve from justice—they have become firewood for Hell.’”
But had they gone straight on the right mode (of life)  , We would have given them plenty of water to drink,
so as to test them with it. And whoever disregards the remembrance of his Lord— He     will insert him into a mounting punishment.
And (say)  that mosques belong to Allah, so do not call upon anyone along with Allah.
 And  that    when the servant of Allah got up, calling upon Him (in prayers)  , they almost fell on him in  a mass    .
 Say    , “Indeed, I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him.”
Say  sg   , “Indeed, I possess for you  pl   neither harm nor prudence.”
Say  sg   , “Indeed, no one can protect me from Allah, and I will not find any refuge except with Him.
 (I have nothing)  except for a proclamation from Allah and His messages, and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger—for him is the fire of Hell, abiding therein forever.
Only when they see what they are promised, will they then know who has weaker helpers and is fewer in numbers.
Say  sg   , “I do not know whether what you  pl   are promised is near, or whether my Lord will extend it for a period.
The Knower of the hidden realm—so He does not disclose His hidden realm to anyone
except to a Messenger of His choosing, for He then dispatches guards before him and behind him,
that  He may know    that they have compiled and proclaimed the messages of their Lord. But He has encompassed what they have, and has tallied everything by number.”
