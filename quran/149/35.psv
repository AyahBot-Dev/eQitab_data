All praise be to Allah, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Maker of the angels as messengers with two and three and four wings. He adds to creation as He wills; indeed, Allah is Powerful over everything.
Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for mankind, none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds, none can release it thereafter. And He is indeed the Almighty, the All-Wise.
O mankind, remember Allah’s blessing upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no god but He, so how can you be averted (from the truth)  ?
And if they disbelieve you  sg   , surely messengers before you were also disbelieved. And to Allah all matters  are returned    .
O mankind, indeed the promise of Allah is true, so let not the Earlier Life deceive you, and let not the Deceiver deceive you regarding Allah.
Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you  pl   , so take him as an enemy; indeed, he only invites his party to be among the fellows of the Blaze.
For those who have denied is a severe punishment, while for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds is forgiveness and a supreme reward.
What about the one whose evil deed was adorned for him and so he came to regard it as good? Allah misguides whomever He wills and He guides whomever He wills, so  let not your self be wasted    sorrowing over them; indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.
And Allah is the One Who sent the  winds    , stirring up clouds, then We  drove them to a lifeless land whereby We revived the earth after it had died; likewise is Resurrection.
Whoever wants might—to Allah belongs all might. To Him ascends good speech, and righteous work lifts it up. But as for those who scheme evil, there is a severe punishment, and the scheming of those is bound to fail.
And Allah created you  pl   from dust, then from a sperm drop, then He made you pairs. And no female carries or delivers except with His knowledge. And no person is given a long life or  has his life cut short    except that it is in a record  ; indeed, that is easy for Allah.
And the two waters are not equal: this one is fresh, sweet, good to drink, while this is salty, bitter. Yet from each you  pl   eat tender meat and extract jewelry which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through them, that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks.
He causes the night to penetrate the day and He causes the day to penetrate the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running for a stated term. Such is Allah, your  pl   Lord; to Him belongs the dominion. But those you call upon apart from Him do not own so much as the mere skin of a date stone.
If you  pl   call upon them, they do not hear your call; and even if they heard, never would they respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will reject your polytheism. And none informs you  sg   like One Who is all-aware.
O mankind, it is you who stand in need of Allah, while Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.
If He wills, He can do away with you  pl   and bring about a new creation.
And that would not be too mighty for Allah.
And no bearer of burden bears the burden of another. And even if a heavily laden one calls for help with its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if the one called be a relative. You are only to warn those who fear their Lord, though unseen, and have established the prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself to his own benefit. And to Allah is the destiny.
Not equal are the blind one and the one who can see,
nor are the darkness (es)  and the light,
nor are the shade and the torrid heat,
nor equal are the living and the dead. Indeed, Allah causes whomever He wills to hear, but you  sg   cannot make those in the graves hear.
You  sg   are only a warner.
Indeed, We have sent you  sg   with the truth, as a herald of glad tidings and a warner. And there is no community but a warner has passed through it.
And if they disbelieve you  sg   , those before them also disbelieved. Their messengers came to them with evident proofs and with the Books and with the illuminating Scripture.
Then I seized those who denied—so how terrible was My condemnation?
Have you  sg   not seen that Allah has sent down water from the sky, and with it We  have brought out products of various colors? And in the mountains are streaks of white and red, varying in their hue, and pitch-black.
Likewise, human beings and animals and livestock come in various colors. Indeed, from among His servants, only the learned fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, Oft-Forgiving.
Indeed, those who read the Scripture of Allah and have established the prayer and have spent of what We have provided for them, secretly and publicly, expect a bargain that will not fail.
That He may render to them their rewards in full and increase them of His grace; He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Ever Thankful.
And what We have revealed to you  sg   of the Scripture is the truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah is most surely All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.
Then We gave the Scripture as a heritage to those of Our servants whom We selected: so of them is one who is unjust to himself, and one who follows a middle course, and one who is a forerunner in good deeds—by Allah’s leave. That is what the great grace is.
Gardens of Eden which  they enter    ; they are adorned therein with  gold bracelets and pearls    , and their garments therein are of silk.
And they said  , “All praise be to Allah Who has lifted all sorrow from us; our Lord is most surely Oft-Forgiving, Ever Thankful.
He Who settled us in the Home of Everlasting Stay, by His grace, where neither toil touches us nor fatigue afflicts us.”
And those who have denied—for them is the fire of Hell wherein they are never finished off and thus die, nor is its punishment lightened for them. Thus  We repay every staunch denier    .
And they scream aloud therein, “Our Lord, get us out, that we may act righteously, unlike the way we used to act.” “Did We not give you  pl   a lifelong enough to take warning if you were going to? And the warner did come to you, so taste  , for there is no supporter for the unjust.”
Indeed, Allah is the Knower of the hidden realm of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of what lies within the chests.
It is He who made you  pl   successors on earth. So whoever denies—his denial is upon him, and the denial of the deniers adds only to their Lord’s loathing of them, and the denial of the deniers adds only to their perdition.
Say, “Have you regarded those associates of yours that you worship apart from Allah? Show me what they have created on earth.” Or do they have any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a scripture such that they rely on  an evident proof    from it? Rather, the unjust promise one another nothing but a deception.
Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they vanish. And were they to vanish, there is none to hold them both except He; indeed, He has always been Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.
And they swore by Allah their most solemn oaths: that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the other communities. Yet when a warner came to them, it only increased them in aversion—
behaving arrogantly in the land and scheming evil. But evil scheming surrounds none but its people. So do they expect anything but the precedent of the ancients? For you  sg   will never find any change in Allah’s rule, and you will never find any deviation in Allah’s rule.
And have they not journeyed through the earth and observed the consequences for those before them, though they were superior to them in strength? But in no way could Allah be thwarted by anything in the heavens or in the earth. Indeed, He has always been All-Knowing, All-Powerful.
And if Allah were to hold mankind accountable for what they have earned, He would not leave a single treading creature on its surface. But He defers them for a stated term, and then when their term is due—indeed, Allah has always been All-Seeing of His servants.
