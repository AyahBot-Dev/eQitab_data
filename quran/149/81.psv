When the sun is rolled up,
and when the stars are dimmed,
and when the mountains are set in motion,
and when pregnant camels are abandoned,
and when the beasts are herded,
and when the oceans are set aflame,
and when the souls are paired,
and when the baby girl that was buried alive is asked
for what misdeed she was  killed    ,
and when the scrolls are  made public    ,
and when the sky is peeled away,
and when purgatory is  set  fully ablaze    ,
and when the Garden (of Paradise)  is brought near—
each soul will know what it has brought forth.
So, no! I swear by those (stars)  receding,
running, sweeping.
By the night as its darkness comes and goes.
By the morn as it breathes—
indeed, it is the word of a noble messenger  ,
endowed with power, eminent with the Lord of the Throne,
obeyed there and trustworthy.
Thus your  pl   fellow is not a madman,
for he most surely saw him on the evident horizon,
and he  does not stingily withhold     (knowledge of)  the hidden realm,
and it is not the word of an outcast Satan.
So where are you  pl   going?
It is but a Reminder to (all creatures of)  all realms,
to whomever of you who wills to be upright.
But you  pl   cannot will unless Allah, the Lord of all realms, wills.
