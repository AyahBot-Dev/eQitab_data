By the night as it covers.
By the day as it reveals.
By the creation of the male and the female—
indeed, your  pl   pursuits are diverse.
So as for the one who has given and has been mindful (of God)  
and has believed in ultimate goodness—
We will ease his way towards ease.
But as for the one who has been stingy and complacent
and has disbelieved in ultimate goodness—
We will ease his way towards difficulty,
and his money will not avail him when he plummets.
Indeed, guidance is upon Us,
and indeed, unto Us belong the Last and the First (life)  .
So I have warned you  pl   of a fierce fire,
in which none roasts except the most wicked—
the onewho disbelieved and turned away.
But the most mindful  sg    (of God)  will be kept away from it—
the one who brings  his wealth to purify himself,
and not in return for any favor to anyone,
except for seeking the countenance of his Lord, the Most High.
And he will certainly be well pleased.
