Sād. By the Recital  containing the Reminder.
Yet those who denied are in a state of might  and opposition.
How many generations have We caused to perish before them, so they called out when it was too late to escape!
And they marveled that a forewarner had come to them from among them, and the deniers said, “This is a sorcerer, a sheer liar.
Did he make all the gods into one God? Surely this is indeed something strange.”
And the chiefs among them proceeded, (saying)  , “Walk away (from the Prophet)  and hold fast to your  pl   gods; indeed this is certainly something planned.
Never have we heard of this in the former creed. This is nothing but an invention.
Was the Reminder sent down to him out of all of us?” Rather, they are doubtful about My Reminder; rather, they have not yet tasted My punishment.
Or do they possess the treasuries of your  sg   Lord’s mercy, the Almighty, the Giver?
Or do they possess the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend by any means.
An army of confederates will be defeated there.
Before them the people of Noah disbelieved, as did ʻĀd  , and Pharaoh of the stakes,
and Thamûd  and the people of Lot and the fellows of the thicket. Those were the parties.
None of them but disbelieved the messengers, so My punishment was deserved.
For these await nothing but a single shout, from which there is no recovery.
Yet they said, “Our Lord, hasten for us our share of punishment before the Day of Reckoning.”
Endure  sg   patiently what they say and remember Our servant David who was endowed with strong faith; indeed, he often turns  to Us.
Indeed, We subjected the mountains to give due exaltations (to God)  with him in the evening and at daybreak,
with the birds made to flock, each often turning to Him.
Thus We strengthened his dominion and brought him wisdom and decisive speech.
And has the tiding of the disputants reached you  sg   , as they climbed the sanctuary—
as they entered upon David, and he was startled by them? They said, “Do not fear; two disputants, one of whom has oppressed the other. So judge between us with the truth and do not be untrue, and guide us to the right path.”
“Indeed, this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have just one ewe, and he said, ‘Entrust it to me,’ and he pressured me with words.”
He said, “He has done you  sg   wrong by asking your ewe in addition to his ewes, and indeed many partners do oppress one another— except those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds, but these are so few.” And David realized that We were testing him, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord and fell down to his knees and turned penitent.
So We forgave him that, and indeed there is most surely for him nearness to Us and a beautiful place to return to.
“O David, We have appointed you as a viceroy in the land, so judge between mankind with the truth and do not follow the whim, lest it misguide you from the way of Allah. Indeed, for those who stray from the way of Allah there is a severe punishment for their having forgotten the Day of Reckoning.”
And in no way have We created the heaven and the earth and whatever is between them in vain. That is the assumption of those who have denied. So woe to those who have denied from the Fire!
Or are We to make those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds equal to those who spread corruption in the earth? Or are We to make the people who are mindful (of God)  equal to the wicked?
A Scripture that We sent down to you  sg   , blessed, that  they     may ponder its signs  and that those endowed with understanding may remind themselves.
And to David We gave Solomon, an excellent servant; indeed, he often turns  to Us.
Recall when the beautiful horses were paraded before him in the evening,
so he said, “Indeed, I have loved the good things with a love more than the remembrance of my Lord, until it  disappeared behind the veil (of night)  .
Bring  pl   them back to me.” And he started to stroke their legs and necks.
And surely, We tested Solomon and cast a body on his throne, then he turned penitent.
He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a dominion never to be attained by anyone after me; indeed, You— only You—are the Giver.”
So We subjected to him the  wind    , flowing gently by his command wherever he directed;
and the demons—every builder and diver;
and others bound together in fetters.
“This is Our gift, so give  sg   generously or withhold, without measure.”
And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a beautiful place to return to.
And recall Our servant Job, when he called out to his Lord, “Satan has touched me with toil and suffering.”
“Stamp your foot—this is a cool washing-place and drinking-place.”
And We gave him back his family and doubled them—a mercy from Us and a reminding for those endowed with understanding.
“And take with your  sg   hand a bundle of grass, and strike with it so as not to breach (your oath)  .” Indeed, We found him patient. What an excellent servant; indeed, he often turns  a   unto Us.
And recall  sg   Our servants    Abraham and Isaac and Jacob—those endowed with strong faith and with sight (s)  .
Surely We distinguished them with  a distinct quality     —the remembrance of the (final)  Home.
And indeed, to Us they are of the elect, the outstanding.
And recall  sg   Ishmael and Elisha and Ezekiel—and all are of the outstanding.
This is a Reminder. For indeed, for the mindful (of God)  is a beautiful place to return to:
the Gardens of Eden, with their doors wide-open for them,
relaxing therein and calling for abundant fruit and beverage.
And with them are bashful maidens of equal age.
This is what  you     are promised for the Day of Reckoning.
Indeed, such is Our provision, inexhaustible.
All this. But indeed, for those who exceed all limits is a miserable place to return to:
Hell, in which they roast—so what a miserable resting place!
All this, so let them taste it—scalding water and purulence.
And  another     (torment)  similar to it, of diverse kinds.
“This is a crowd rushing headlong with you  pl   .” They are not welcome; indeed, they are to be roasted in the Fire.
They said, “But it is you  pl   who are not welcome! It is you who brought it upon us! So what a miserable end!”
They said, “Our Lord, whoever brought this upon us, give him double punishment in the Fire.”
And they said, “What is it with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the  villains? 
 Did we take them with mockery    , or have our sight (s)  swerved from them?
Indeed, that is certainly true: the disputing among the inhabitants of the Fire.
Say  sg   , “Indeed, I am only a forewarner, for there is no god except Allah—the One, the Subduer,
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Almighty, the Forgiver.”
Say  sg   , “It is a great tiding
which you  pl   disregard.
I have had no knowledge of the Highest Assembly as they disputed.
It is only revealed to  me  that    I am an evident warner.”
Recall when Your  sg   Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I am creating a human being from clay.
So when I have formed him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall prostrate before him.
So the angels fell prostrate, all of them, entirely—
but not Iblis  ; he acted arrogantly and became one of the deniers.
He said, “O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating before what I created with My Own hands? Have you acted arrogantly, or have you become one of the exalted?”
He said, “I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.”
He said, “Then get out of it, for you are indeed an outcast!
And indeed, My curse is upon you until the Day of Recompense.”
He said, “My Lord, then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected.”
He said, “Then indeed, you are of those reprieved
until the Day of the Time Appointed.”
He said, “Then, by Your majesty, I will most surely delude them all,
except for your  sincere chosen    servants among them.”
He said, “So  the truth     is —and only the truth I say—
I will surely fill Hell with you  sg   and with whoever of them who follows you, all together.”
Say  sg   , “I ask of you no reward for this, and I am not a pretender.
It is but a Reminder to (all creatures of)  all realms.
And you  pl   will certainly know its tiding after a while.”
