Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth has been highly exalting Allah, and He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
O you who have attained faith, why do you say what you do not do?
It is most loathsome to Allah that you pl say what you do not do.
Indeed, Allah loves those who combat in His way, lining up in ranks as though they were a compact structure.
And recall when Moses said to his people, “O my people, why do you hurt me, though you know that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And when they swerved, Allah caused their hearts to swerve, for Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.
And recall when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Children of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah and a bearer of glad tidings of a messenger who comes after me, whose name is Ahmad.” Yet when he came to them with evident proofs, they said, “This is evident sorcery .”
And who is more unjust than one who fabricated lies against Allah when he was being invited to Islam? Thus Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with their mouths, but Allah shall perfect His Light, even though the deniers hate it.
It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over all religion, even though the pagans hate it.
O you who have attained faith, shall I inform you of a bargain that will save you from a painful punishment?
That you pl believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the way of Allah with your wealth and yourselves; that is better for you, if you only knew—
He will forgive you pl your misdeeds and will enter you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and into beautiful residences in the Gardens of Eden; that is the great triumph.
And something else you pl love: support from Allah and an imminent conquest. So give glad tidings to the believers.
O you who have attained faith, be the supporters of Allah as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples, “Who are my supporters towards Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the supporters of Allah.” Then a faction of the Children of Israel attained faith while another faction denied it, and We aided those who had attained faith against their enemy, so they came to prevail.
