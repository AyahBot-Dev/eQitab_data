By the fig and the olive.
By Mount Tûr of Sinai.
By this safe city  —
surely, We created man in the best state,
then We returned him to the lowest of the low,
except those who attained faith and did righteous deeds, for for them is an unfailing reward.
So what makes you  sg   still deny the recompense?
Is Allah not the Wisest of judges?
