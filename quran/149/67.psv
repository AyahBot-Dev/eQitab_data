Supremely Blessed be He in whose hand is the dominion, and He is All- Powerful over everything;
the One Who created death and life to test you  pl   as to which of you is better in conduct, for He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving;
the One Who created seven heavens in layers: you  sg   see no discrepancy in the creation of the All-Merciful. So look again: can you see any splits?
Then look again and again—your  sg   sight will return to you bedazzled and exhausted.
And indeed, We have adorned the lowest  heaven with lanterns and made them missiles against the Satans, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.
And for those who have denied their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and what a miserable destiny!
When they are thrown into it, they hear it roaring as it seethes—
it almost bursts with rage. Every time a crowd is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, “Did no warner come to you?”
They said  , “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we disbelieved and said, ‘Allah did not bestow anything from on high; it is you  pl   who are greatly misguided!’”
And they said, “Had we listened or reasoned, we would not have been among the fellows of the Blaze.”
Thus they acknowledged their misdeed, so away with the fellows of the Blaze.
Indeed, for those who fear their Lord though Unseen, there is forgiveness and a supreme reward.
And keep your  pl   words secret or say them aloud—indeed, He is All-Knowing of what lies within the chests.
Would He not know whomever He has created, while He is the Subtle, the All-Aware?
It is He who made the earth manageable for you  pl   , so walk through its regions and eat of His provision, and to Him is the Resurrection.
Are you  pl   confident that the One in heaven will not cause the earth to collapse beneath you as it spins?
Or are you confident that the One in heaven will not unleash against you a violent storm? Then you will know what My  warning is like.
And surely those before them disbelieved (as well)  , so how terrible was My condemnation!
Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding them? None holds them except the All-Merciful; indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything.
Or who is this who is an army for you  pl   , supporting you, apart from the All-Merciful? Indeed, the deniers are in nothing but a deception.
Or who is this that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? Rather, they persist in defiance and aversion.
Is one who walks bent on his own face better guided or one who walks upright on a straight path?
Say  sg   , “It is He Who initiated you  pl   and made for you hearing and sight (s)  and burning hearts; rarely do you give thanks.”
Say  sg   , “It is He Who scattered you  pl   on earth, and to Him you will be herded.”
And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled if you  pl   are truthful?”
Say  sg   , “Indeed, knowledge is only with Allah, and indeed, I am only an evident warner.”
But when they saw it approaching, the faces of those who had denied turned gloomy, and it was said, “This is what you  pl   used to  claim     (would never happen)  .”
Say  sg   , “Have you seen: if Allah makes me and those with me perish or has mercy on us, who then will protect the deniers from a painful punishment?”
Say  sg   , “He is the All-Merciful; we have attained faith in Him, and in Him alone we have placed our trust, and soon  you   pl    will know    who is in evident misguidance.”
Say  sg   , “Have you  pl   seen:if your water drains away, who then will bring you pure running water?”
