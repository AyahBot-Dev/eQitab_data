Tâ Sîn Mīm.
Those are the signs of the Evident Scripture.
We read to you sg from the tiding of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people who believe.
Indeed, Pharaoh became exalted in the land and divided its people into sects, deeming a faction of them weak and oppressed: slaughtering their sons while keeping their women alive (in bondage) . Indeed, he was one of the corrupters.
Thus We are willing to favor those who were deemed weak and oppressed in the land and to make them leaders and to make them the inheritors
and to establish them in the land and to show Pharaoh and Hamān and their troops from them the very thing they used to fear .
And We revealed to Moses’ mother, “Nurse him, then when you fear for him, cast him into the waters and do not fear and do not grieve; We are surely returning him to you and making him one of the emissaries.”
Then Pharaoh’s folk picked him up (only) to be an enemy and a (source of) grief for them. Indeed, Pharaoh and Hamān and their troops were wrongdoers.
So Pharaoh’s wife said, “A comfort to the eye for me and for you sg . Do pl not kill him; hopefully he may be useful to us, or we may take him as a son.” And they were unaware.
And Moses’ mother felt a void in her burning heart so that she almost declared him, had We not steadied her heart, that she may remain of the believers.
Thus she said to his sister, “Trail him.” So she watched him from afar while they were unaware.
And We had forbidden all wet nurses for him, so she said, “Shall I tell you pl about a household that can raise him for you and look after him?”
Thus We returned him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted and that she may not grieve, and so that she would know that Allah’s promise is true; yet most of them do not know.
And when he had attained his full strength and had matured, We gave him wise judgment and knowledge, for thus do We repay thosewho excel in doing good.
And (one day) he entered the city unnoticed by its people and found in it two men fighting—one of his own sect and one from his enemies, so the one of his sect solicited his assistance against the one from his enemies, so Moses struck him and put an end to him. He said, “This is of Satan’s work; he is indeed an evidently misguiding enemy.”
He said, “My Lord, I have indeed been unjust to myself, so forgive me.” So He forgave him; indeed, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Bestower of mercy.
He said, “My Lord, because of the blessings You have bestowed upon me, I shall not be a backup for criminals.”
So the next morning he was walking about the city, fearful (and) vigilant, when suddenly the man who had sought his support the day before cried out to him. Moses said to him, “You are an evident deluder.”
And as he was about to strike the one who was their enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the reformers.”
And a man came running from the farthest part of the city; he said, “O Moses, the chiefs are conspiring to kill you, so get out; I am indeed one of those who seek to advise you.”
So he went out of it, fearful (and) vigilant; he said, “My Lord, deliver me from the unjust people.”
And as he headed towards Midian, he said, “Hopefully, my Lord will guide me to the right way.”
And when he arrived at the waters of Midian he found there a crowd of people drawing water, and he found two women holding their flocks on the side. He said, “What is the matter with you dl ?” They said, “We cannot draw water until the shepherds depart, and our father is a very old man.”
So he drew water for them and then turned away to the shade and said, “My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good you have sent down for me.”
Then one of them came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is calling you to repay you, as a reward for drawing water for us.” So when he came to him and narrated to him the narratives, he said, “Do not fear; you are (now) safe from the unjust people.”
One of them said, “Father, hire him; indeed, the best one you can hire is one who is strong (and)trustworthy.”
He said, “I surely wish to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, provided you work for me for the term of eight pilgrimages; but if you complete ten, that is up to you, for I do not desire to impose any hardship on you. You will find me, Allah willing, one of the righteous.”
He said, “Let this be (an agreement) between you and me; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, I will not have transgressed, and Allah is a trustee over what we say.”
So when Moses had completed the term and journeyed with his family, he noticed a fire by the side of Mount Tûr. He said to his family, “Stay here; I have surely glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you pl some information from there, or an ember from the fire, that you may warm yourselves.”
So when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley at the blessed spot, from the tree: “O Moses, indeed I—I alone—am Allah, Lord of all realms.
So throw down your sg staff.” And when he saw it shaking as if it were a snake, he turned away, fleeing, and did not look back. “O Moses, come forward and do not fear; you are indeed of the secure ones.
Put your sg hand inside your garment; it will come out white, without any bad affliction. And clasp to you your arm, that you should not be overawed, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs; indeed, they have been a defiantly disobedient people.”
He said, “My Lord, I have in fact killed one of them, and I fear lest they kill me.
And my brother Aaron—he is more eloquent than me, so send him with me as an assistant to confirm me; I do fear that they will disbelieve me.”
He said, “We will strengthen your sg shoulder with your brother and give you dl authority so they will not be able to reach you. With Our signs, you dl and those who follow you will be the overcomers.”
So when Moses came to them with Our signs, evident, they said, “This is nothing but fabricated sorcery, and We never heard of this among our ancient forefathers.”
 Thus Moses said, “My Lord knows better of the one who brings guidance from Him and who will have the future outcome of the Home; indeed, the unjust never succeed.”
And Pharaoh said, “O chiefs, I have never known of any god for you other than me. So fire-up clay-bricks for me, O Haman, and build me a tower, that perhaps I may view the God of Moses, though I definitely think he is of the liars.”
Thus he and his troops went arrogantly about the land without any right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.
So We took him and his troops and We threw them into the waters, so look what the outcome was for the unjust ones.
And We made them leaders calling to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they are not supported.
And We caused a curse to follow them in this Earlier (Life) , and on the Day of Resurrection they are of the despised.
And We certainly brought Moses the Scripture after We had annihilated the earliest generations, as insights for mankind, and guidance and mercy, that perhaps they would remind themselves.
And you sg were not on the western side (of the Mount) when We decreed the command to Moses, nor were you sg of the witnesses.
Yet We established many generations , then the ages became seemingly long. Nor were you among the people of Midian, reading Our signs to them; but We have been sending emissaries.
Nor were you by the side of Mount Tûr when We called out. Rather, it was a mercy from your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, that perhaps they would remind themselves.
And (We have sent you as a messenger) lest a calamity befall them as a result of what their hands have put forth, and they say, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your signs and been among the believers.”
But when the truth came to them from Our Providence, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses.” Did they not deny what was given to Moses in the past? They said, “Two works of sorcery , backing one another.” And they said, “We deny both.”
Say sg , “Then bring a scripture from Allah more conducive to guidance than both of them and I will follow it, if you pl are truthful.”
But if they do not respond to you sg , know that they only follow their whims. And who is more misguided than one who follows his own whim without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the unjust people.
And surely We have conveyed the Word to them, that they may remind themselves.
Those to whom We brought the Scripture before it believe in it,
and when it is recited to them, they say, “We have believed in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord; indeed, we were Muslims prior to it.”
Those are brought their reward twice on account of how they persevered patiently. And they counter evil with good and they spend from what We have provided them.
And when they hear idle talk they disregard it and say, “We have our deeds and you pl have your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not seek (the company of) ignorant people.”
Indeed, you sg cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills, and He knows better of those who are guided.
And they said, “If we follow the guidance with you sg , we will be snatched from our land.” Did We not establish for them a safe sanctuary to which all kinds of products are brought as provision from Ourself? But most of them do not know.
And how many a town did We annihilate for becoming unappreciative of its livelihood? So here are their residences, uninhabited after them but little, and We have always been the inheritors.
And in no way would your sg Lord annihilate towns until He had sent to their mother-town a messenger reading to them Our signs . And in no way would We annihilate towns except if their people are unjust.
And whatever you pl have been brought is (merely) the enjoyment of the Earlier Life and its adornment, but what is with Allah is better and longer lasting. Do you not reason ?
Can someone to whom We have made a fine promise—which he is bound to encounter—be equal to someone whom We have allowed to enjoy the enjoyment of the Earlier Life, then on the Day of Resurrection will be one of the arraigned?
On the day when He calls to them and says, “Where are My associates whom you used to claim?”
Those against whom the sentence was justified said , “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we deluded. We deluded them as we ourselves were deluded. We declare our innocence before You; it was not us that they used to worship.”
And it was said, “Call on your pl associates.” So they called them, but they did not respond to them, and they saw the punishment. If only they had sought guidance!
And on the day when He calls to them and says, “What did you respond to the emissaries?”
Then all tidings were obscured a for them on that day so they are unable to ask each other.
But as for one who has repented and has attained faith and has acted righteously—hopefully, he will become of the successful.
And your sg Lord creates whatever He wills and He chooses. Never could the choice be theirs. Highly Exalted is Allah, and Most High is He above the associations they make.
And your sg Lord knows whatever their chests harbor and whatever they make public.
And He is Allah; there is no god but He. To Him belongs all praise in the First (life) and in the Hereafter, and to Him you pl are returned .
Say sg , “Have you pl seen if Allah were to make the night perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah would bring you illumination? Do you not hear?”
Say sg , “Have you pl seen if Allah were to make the day perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah would bring you night to rest in? Do you not observe?”
But out of His mercy, He has made for you pl night and day so that you may rest in it and seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks.
And on the day when He calls to them and says, “Where are My associates whom you used to claim?”
And We drew a out from every community a witness, then said, “Produce your proof,” so they realized that the truth belongs to Allah, and whatever they used to fabricate strayed away from them.
Indeed, Qarun was of the people of Moses, but he oppressed them. And We had given him treasures, the keys of which would weigh down a band of strong men. Recall when his people said to him, “Do not exult; surely, Allah does not love the exultant.
And seek in whatever Allah has brought you sg the Home of the Hereafter, and do not forget your share of the Earlier (Life) , and do good as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek corruption in the land; indeed, Allah does not like the corrupters.”
He said, “Indeed, it was only brought to me on account of knowledge I possess.” Did he not know that before him Allah had annihilated many generations who were stronger than he and hadcollected greater riches? And the criminals will not be asked about their misdeeds.
And he came out before his people in his splendor; those who wanted the Earlier Life said, “If only we possessed the likes of what Qarun was given. He is indeed very fortunate.”
But those who were given knowledge said, “Woe to you! The recompense of Allah is better for those who have attained faith and have acted righteously.” Yet none is granted it except the patient ones.
So We caused the earth to swallow him and his home, then he had no battalion to support him apart from Allah, and he was not of those who could help themselves.
And by morning the ones who only yesterday had wished they were in his position were saying, “Indeed, it is Allah who extends His provision for whomever He wills of His servants, and He restrains (it) . Had Allah not been gracious to us, He would have caused it to swallow us . No wonder the deniers never succeed.”
That is the Home of the Hereafter—We assign it for those who want no exaltation in the land nor corruption. And the future outcome is for those who are mindful (of God) .
Whoever has come with a good deed—for him there is better than it, but whoever has come with an evil deed—those who have done evil deeds will only be rewarded for what they used to do.
Indeed, He Who ordained the Recital upon you sg will surely return you to a great place of return. Say sg , “My Lord knows better who brings guidance and who is the one in evident misguidance.”
And you did not (even) expect the Scripture would be cast to you sg , yet (it was revealed to you) as a mercy from your Lord, so never be a backup for the deniers.
And do not let them bar you sg from Allah’s signs after they have been sent down to you. And call to your Lord, and never be of those who associate (others with God) .
And do not call sg upon any other god with Allah; there is no god but He. All things perish except His Countenance. Judgment belongs (only) to Him, and to Him you pl are returned .
