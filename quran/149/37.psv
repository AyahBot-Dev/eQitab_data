By those aligned, lined up in ranks.
Then by the propellers propelling firmly.
Then by the readers of a Reminder—
indeed, your pl God is surely One,
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and Lord of the Easts.
Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment, the planets ,
and as a protection against every defiant devil.
They cannot eavesdrop on the Higher Assembly, for they get bombarded from every side—
repelled, and they will have an unremitting punishment,
except for one who snatched a fragment and was then pursued by a piercing meteor.
So inquire sg of them, “Are they more difficult to create, or the others We created?” Indeed, We created them from sticky clay.
Rather, you sg were amazed as they ridicule.
And when reminded, they remember not.
And when they see a sign, they exaggerate in ridiculing
and say, “This is nothing but evident sorcery.
 Can it be that when we have died and become dust and bones, can it be that we will really be resurrected?
 And our ancient forefathers?”
Say sg , “Yes indeed, and you will be totally subdued.”
It is but a single nudge, and there they are looking on (in bewilderment) !
And they said , “Woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense.”
“This is the Day of Decision which you pl used to deny.
Herd pl those who were unjust and their spouses, and what they used to worship
apart from Allah, and guide them to the path to purgatory.
And stop them—indeed, they are to be questioned.”
“What is the matter with you pl that you do not help one another?”
Rather, on this day, they are submissive.
And they came g to one another, asking one another.
They said, “Indeed, you pl used to come at us from the right ”
They said, “Rather, you pl yourselves were not believers,
and we had no authority over you; rather, you yourselves were a people who exceeded all limits.
And therefore we deserved our Lord’s decree on us. Most surely we will all get a taste,
for we deluded you pl ; indeed, we were deluded.”
So on that day, they are indeed partners in the punishment.
This is what We do with the criminals.
Indeed, when it was said to them, “There is no god except Allah,” they would act arrogantly
and say, “Are we really to abandon our gods for a mad poet?”
In fact, he came with the truth, and he confirmed the emissaries.
Most surely, you pl will taste the painful punishment,
and in no way will you be repaid except for what you used to do,
except for Allah’s sincere chosen servants.
For those, there is a known provision:
fruits, and they are honored
in the Gardens of Bliss,
on couches facing one another.
A drink is passed round among them from a flowing spring:
white, a delight to those who drink,
no headiness in it, nor by it are they drained .
And with them are bashful maidens with lovely eyes,
as if they were closely guarded eggs.
So they came to one another, asking one another.
One of them said, “Indeed, I did have a comrade
who would say, ‘Can it be that you sg are really of those who believe?
 Can it be that when we have died and become dust and bones, can it be that we will really be called to account?’”
He said (to his companions in Paradise) , “Can you pl view (him) ?”
Then he viewed (him) and saw him in the midst of purgatory.
He said, “(I swear) by Allah, you sg almost ruined me.
And were it not for the blessing of my Lord, I would have been of the arraigned.”
“Are we (then) not to die
except for our first death? And are we never to be punished?”
It is most surely this which is the great triumph.
For the like of this let the workers work.
Is this a better hospitality or the Tree of Zaqqum ?
Indeed, We have made it a means of trial for the unjust.
Indeed, it is a tree that comes out from the very origin of purgatory.
Its yield is as if it were devils’ heads.
So they are sure to eat from it and fill their bellies with it.
Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of scalding water.
Then their return is sure to be to purgatory.
Indeed, they found their forefathers astray,
so they rush along in their footsteps.
And certainly, most of the ancients before them went astray.
And certainly, We sent among them forewarners.
So look sg at what the outcome was for those who were warned,
except for Allah’s sincere chosen servants.
And certainly, Noah called out to Us, so the very excellent of responders are We!
Thus We delivered him and his family from the great calamity,
and We made his offspring the sole survivors,
and We left him thus to be remembered among later generations.
Peace be upon Noah among (all creatures of) all realms.
Indeed, thus do We repay those who excel in doing good.
Indeed, he is one of Our believing servants.
Then We drowned the others.
And, indeed, of his kind is Abraham.
Recall when he came to his Lord with a sound heart.
He said to his father and his people, “What are you worshiping?
Is it false gods, instead of Allah, that you pl want?
So what is your pl opinion about the Lord of all realms?”
Then he took one look at the stars
and said, “I am sick.”
So they turned away from him, fleeing,
whereupon he turned to their gods and said, “Will you pl not eat?
What is it with you pl ? Do you not speak?”
Then he turned on them, striking with his right hand.
So they came towards him, dashing .
He said, “Do you worship what you carve,
when Allah has created you pl and all that you do?”
They said, “Build a structure for him and throw him into purgatory.”
So they desired to plot against him, but We made them the lowest.
And then he said, “I am going to my Lord—He will guide me.”
“My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
So We gave him glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
Then, when he was old enough to accompany him, he said, “O my child, I see in a dream that I am sacrificing you, so look— what do you see ?” He said, “O my father, do as you are commanded; you will find me, Allah willing, of the patient ones.”
Then, when they dl had submitted and he laid him down on his forehead,
We then called out to him, “O Abraham!
You sg have truly fulfilled the vision.” Thus indeed do We repay those who excel in doing good.
Indeed, this was certainly the evident test.
And We redeemed him with a great sacrifice,
and We left him thus to be remembered among later generations:
“Peace be upon Abraham.”
Thus We repay those who excel in doing good.
Indeed, he is one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him glad tidings of Isaac, a prophet, one of the righteous.
And We blessed him and Isaac. But of their offspring is one who excels in doing good and one who is evidently unjust to himself.
And We certainly conferred Our favor upon Moses and Aaron,
and We delivered them dl and their people from the great calamity.
And We supported them pl , so they were the overcomers.
And We gave them dl the evidential Scripture,
and We guided them dl upon the straight path.
And We left them dl thus to be remembered among later generations:
“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.”
Thus do We repay those who excel in doing good.
Indeed, they are of Our believing servants.
And Elijah is indeed one of the emissaries.
Recall when he said to his people, “Will you not be mindful (of God) ?
Do you pl call upon Baʻl and leave the best of creators — 
 Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers?”
But they disbelieved him, and thus they will certainly be arraigned,
except for Allah’s sincere chosen servants.
And We left him thus to be remembered among later generations:
“Peace be upon Elijah .”
Thus do We repay those who excel in doing good.
Indeed, he is one of Our believing servants.
And Lot is indeed one of the emissaries.
Recall when We delivered him and all of his family,
except for an old woman who lingered behind.
Then We annihilated the others.
And most surely you pl pass by them in the morning
and at night. Do you not reason?
And Jonah is indeed one of the emissaries.
Recall when he fled to the overloaded ship,
and he drew lots and was of those who lost.
Then the whale took him into its mouth, and he was to blame.
And had he not been one of those who highly exalt God,
he would have stayed in its belly until the day they are resurrected.
Then We threw him into the wilderness while he was sick,
and We germinated a gourd tree over him.
Then We sent him to a hundred thousand or more.
And they attained faith, so We gave them enjoyment for some time.
So inquire sg of them, “Are the daughters for your sg Lord while for them are the sons?”
Or did We create the angels as females while they witnessed?”
Undoubtedly, it is out of their utter falsehood that they do indeed say,
“Allah has begotten.” But they are most surely liars.
Has He selected daughters over sons?
What is it with you pl ? How do you judge?
Will you not remind yourselves ?
Or do you pl have an evident manifestation?
Then bring your pl scripture, if you have been truthful.
And they invented a relationship between Him and (the race of) unseen beings . And certainly, (the race of) unseen beings knew that they (who made the claims) would surely be arraigned—
Highly Exalted is Allah far above what they describe—
except for Allah’s sincere chosen servants.
Thus surely, you pl and what you worship
can never seduce (anyone) away from Him,
except for one who is to roast in purgatory.
“And there is not one of us but has an assigned position.
And we are indeed the aligned.
And we are indeed those who exalt God.”
Even though they used to say,
“Had we received a Reminder from the ancients ,
we would have been Allah’s sincere chosen servants.”
But they denied it, so they will find out.
And most surely Our Word has already gone out to our servant emissaries:
indeed, it is they who shall surely be supported,
and indeed it is Our soldiers who shall surely be the overcomers.
So turn sg away from them for some time,
and watch them—for they will soon see.
Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
Yet, when it descends into their courtyard, miserable shall be the morning of those forewarned .
And turn sg away from them for a while,
and watch—they will soon see.
Highly Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of Might, far above what they describe.
And peace be upon the emissaries.
And all praise be to Allah, Lord of all realms.
