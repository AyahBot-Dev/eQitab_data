Alif Lām Ra. A Scripture whose signs were perfected, then detailed, from One Who is All-Wise, All-Aware:
that you pl shall worship none but Allah. (Say) , “Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a herald of glad tidings.
So ask pl your Lord for forgiveness then repent to Him, that He may grant you good enjoyment for a stated term and bestow His grace upon every graceful one. But if they turn away, then I fear for you the punishment of a supreme day.
To Allah is your return, and He is All-Powerful over everything.”
Undoubtedly, they do bend their chests to hide from Him. Undoubtedly, even as they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public; He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests.
And there is no treading creature in the earth but its provision depends on Allah, and He knows its residence and its depository; all is in an evident record .
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days —and His Throne was upon the waters—in order to test you as to which of you is better in conduct. And if you sg were to say, “You pl will be resurrected after death,” those who denied would most surely say, “This is nothing but evident sorcery .”
And if We were to defer the punishment from them until a fixed period of time, they would most surely say, “What holds it back?” Undoubtedly, on the day when it comes to them, it is not averted from them, and they became surrounded by what they used to ridicule.
And if We were to give man a taste of mercy from Us and then withdraw it from him, he is very truly a constantly despairing, staunch denier.
And if We were to give him a taste of prosperity after some adversity has touched him, he would most surely say, “Troubles have gone away from me;” he is very truly exultant, boastful—
except for those who have been patient and have done righteous deeds; for those there is forgiveness and a supreme reward.
So would you sg possibly leave out some of what is revealed to you, and would your chest be tightened by it, because they say, “If only a treasure were sent down to him or an angel came with him?” Indeed, you are only a warner, and Allah is aTrustee over everything.
Or do they say, “He has fabricated it?” Say sg , “Then produce ten surahs like it, fabricated, and call upon whomever you can apart from Allah, if you are truthful.”
But if they do not respond to you pl , know that it was sent down with Allah’s knowledge and that there is no god but He, so will you then become Muslims ?
Whoever has been wanting the Earlier Life and its adornment—We will render to them in full (the reward for) their deeds therein, and therein they will not be defrauded.
Those are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire, and whatever they used to do therein has been nullified, and worthless is what they used to do.
Is someone who has been relying on evident proof from his Lord, and it is read by a witness from Him, and before it the Scripture of Moses—a guide and a mercy… ? Those believe in it . But whoever denies it from among the (various) parties—the Fire is his promised place. So do not regard it with skepticism; it is the truth from your Lord, but most of mankind does not believe.
And who is more unjust than someone who fabricated lies about Allah? Those are presented before their Lord, and the notable witnesses say, “These are the ones who lied about their Lord.” Undoubtedly, the curse of Allah is upon the unjust
who bar (others) from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and regarding the Hereafter they are deniers.
Those were never able to thwart (God) on earth, for never did they have any protectors apart from Allah. Punishment for them is multiplied. Never were they able to hear, nor could they see. 
Those are the ones who lost their (inner) selves, and whatever they used to fabricate strayed away from them.
Without doubt, in the Hereafter they are the biggest losers.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds and have humbled themselves before their Lord—those are the fellows of theGarden (of Paradise) ; therein they abide.
The parable of the two groups is that of one who is blind and deaf, and one who is seeing and hearing. Are they equal in similitude? Will you not remind yourselves ?
And very truly We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you an evident warner:
that you shall worship none but Allah; indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”
So the chiefs of his people, who denied, said, “We do not see that you are anything but a human being like us, and we do not see that you are followed except by the lowliest among us, those of immature opinion, and we do not see that you pl have any advantage over us. Rather, we think you are liars.”
He said, “O my people, have you seen? What if I rely on evident proof from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy of His own, but it was made invisible to you —can we compel you to accept it even though you dislike it?
And O my people, I ask of you no wealth for it; my reward lies only with Allah. And I will never expel those who have attained faith; they are bound to meet their Lord, whereas I see that you are a people who act in ignorance.
And O my people, who will support me against Allah if I expel them? Will you not remind yourselves a ?
And I do not say to you, ‘I possess the treasuries of Allah’, and I know not what is hidden; nor do I say, ‘I am indeed an angel;’ nor do I say of those whom your eyes scorn, ‘Allah will never give them any good.’ Allah knows better about what lies within their (inner) selves. (If I were to say so,) then I would indeed be one of the unjust.”
They said, “O Noah, you have argued with us and have kept arguing for too long. Now bring upon us what you promise us, if you have been of the truthful.”
He said, “It is Allah Who brings it upon you if He wills, and you can never thwart (Him) .
And my advice will not benefit you—even if I wanted to advise you—in case Allah wants to delude you. He is your Lord, and to Him you are returned .”
Or do they say, “He has fabricated it?” Say, “If I have fabricated it, then upon me falls my crime, and I am innocent of the crimes you commit.”
And it was revealed to Noah: “Certainly, none of your people will attain faith except those who have already attained faith, so do not grieve over what they have been doing.
And build the ship under Our eyes and with Our inspiration, and do not address Me regarding those who have done injustice; they are to be drowned.”
And he builds the ship, and whenever some chiefs from among his people passed by him, they would mock him. He said, “If you mock us, surely we mock you just as you mock;
then you will come to know upon whom shall come a punishment that disgraces him, and upon whom a perpetual punishment shall fall.”
Until, when Our command came and the oven overflowed , We said, “Carry in it, of each kind, a male and female couple , and your family—except those against whom the sentence has already been passed—and those who have attained faith.” But none attained faith with him except a few.
And he said, “Embark in it. In the name of Allah shall be its sailing and its anchorage . My Lord is most surely Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.”
And so it sails b with them amidst waves like mountains. And Noah called to his son who had kept away, “O my child! Embark with us and do not be with the deniers.”
He said, “I will take shelter on a mountain which can safeguard me from the water.” He said, “There is no safeguard from Allah’s command today, except for the one on whom He has bestowed mercy.” And the waves surged between them, and he became of the drowned.
And it was said, “O land, swallow your waters,” and “O sky, clear up.” And the waters receded, and the matter was concluded, and it settled on (mount) Judei, and it was said: “Away with the unjust people.”
And Noah called to his Lord and said, “O My Lord, my son is indeed of my family, and Your promise is indeed the truth, and You are the Wisest of all judges.”
He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family; surely, it is an unrighteous deed , so do not ask Me about something you know nothing about; I surely admonish you lest you be one of the ignorant.”
He said, “O My Lord, I do seek refuge with You from asking You about what I have no knowledge of, and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”
It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace from Us, and with blessings upon you and upon communities that will spring from those with you. And to (other) communities We shall grant enjoyment, then a painful punishment from Us will touch them.”
That is of the stories of the hidden realm which we reveal to you sg ; never were you nor your people to know them before this, so be patient; the future outcome surely belongs to the people who are mindful (of God) .
And to ʻĀd, their brother Hud. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no other god but Him; you are nothing but fabricators.
O my people, I ask you no reward for it; my reward is only from the One Who originated me. Do you not reason?
And, O my people, ask forgiveness from your Lord then repent to Him. He will send down abundant rain from the sky for you and will add strength to your strength. But do not turn away as criminals.”
They said, “O Hud, you did not come to us with any evident proof, and we shall not abandon our gods for your words, and we shall not believe in you.
We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah to witness, and you to witness, that I am innocent of what you associate
apart from Him. So plot against me, all together, then do not reprieve me.
I have indeed placed my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a treading creature but He holds it by its forelock; indeed, my Lord is on a straight path.
But if they turn away , then I have conveyed to you what I was sent to you with. And my Lord will make other people succeed you, and you will not harm Him at all. My Lord is indeed a Constant Preserver over everything.”
Thus when Our command came, We delivered Hud and those who had attained faith with him, by mercy from Us, and We delivered them from a harsh punishment.
And that was ʻĀd: they repudiated the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant.
And they were pursued by a curse in this Earlier (Life) and on the Day of Resurrection. Undoubtedly, ʻĀd did deny their Lord. Undoubtedly, away with ʻĀd, the people of Hud.
And to Thamûd, their brother Saleh. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him; He initiated you from the earth and assigned you to develop it, so seek His forgiveness and then repent to Him. My Lord is indeed Near, Responsive.”
They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you before this. Are you forbidding us from worshiping what our parents worship? And most surely, we are in serious doubt regarding what you are calling us to.”
He said, “O my people, have you seen: if I rely on evident proof from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Him? Who then would support me against Allah if I disobeyed Him? For you add nothing to me except causing losses.
And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah—a sign for you—so let her graze in Allah’s land and do not touch her with any harm lest an imminent punishment overtake you.”
But they hamstrung her, so he said, “Enjoy yourselves in your home for three days; that is a promise not to be belied.”
Then when Our command came, We delivered Saleh and those who had attained faith with him, by mercy from Us, and from the disgrace of that day. Indeed, your Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.
And those who had done injustices were taken away by the Shout and became motionless bodies in their homes,
as if they had never prospered therein. Undoubtedly, Thamûd did deny their Lord. Undoubtedly, away with Thamûd.
And very truly, Our messengers came to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace,” and soon after he came with a roasted calf.
But when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he distrusted them and conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do not fear; we have indeed been sent to the people of Lot.”
And his wife was standing by, so she laughed. And We gave her glad tidings of Isaac , and after Isaac, Jacob.
She said, “Woe to me. Shall I give birth when I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? This is truly an amazing thing!”
They said, “Are you amazed at the command of Allah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are upon you, O people of the house. He is indeed Praiseworthy, Glorious.”
And when Abraham’s fear had subsided and the glad tidings had reached him—he argues with Us concerning the people of Lot.
Most surely, Abraham is forbearing, imploring, penitent.
“O Abraham, disregard this; surely your Lord’s command has come, and an irreversible punishment shall surely be brought upon them.”
And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled over them and concerned for them, and he said, “This is a dreadful day.”
And his people came rushing towards him, while earlier they were in the habit of doing evil deeds. He said, “O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you, so be mindful of Allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not one prudent man among you?”
They said, “You have (long) known that we have no right to your daughters, and surely you know well what we want.”
He said, “If only I had strength against you or could rely on some intense support.”
They said, “O Lot, we are the messengers of your Lord; they will not reach you, so take your family on a journey while yet a part of the night remains, and let none of you look back. But not your wife —she will be afflicted by that which afflicts them. Indeed, their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning near?”
And when Our command came, We turned it upside down, and We rained down on it stones of baked clay,
marked from your sg Lord , and never far from the unjust pl .
And to Midian, their brother Shuaib. He said, “O my people, worship Allah—you have no god other than Him—and do not give short measure or short weight. I see you are prospering, but I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing day.”
“O my people, give full measure and full weight with justice, and do not defraud people of their belongings, and do not go wickedly about the land, corrupting it.
A remnant which is granted by Allah is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a constant preserver over you.”
They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer command you that we abandon what our fathers worship or that we should not do with our wealth whatever we will? Very truly, you are the forbearing, prudent one!”
He said, “O my people, can you see? What if I rely on evident proof from my Lord and He has provided me with good provision from Himself? And I have no desire to do what I forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but reform as far as I can. And in no way is my success with anyone except with Allah.In Him I have placed my trust, and to Him I turn penitently.
And O my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you to suffer what was suffered by the people of Noah or the people of Hud or the people of Saleh; and the people of Lot are not far off from you.
And ask your Lord for forgiveness and then repent to Him; my Lord is indeed Bestowing of mercy, Most Loving.”
They said, “O Shuaib, we do not comprehend much of what you say, and we see that you are weak among us; and were it not for your clan, we would have stoned you, for you have no might against us.”
He said, “O my people, is my clan mightier to you than Allah? And you have turned your backs on Him? Indeed, my Lord is All-Encompassing of what you do.
And O my people, act according to your position ; surely, I am also acting (according to mine) ; you will know to whom will come a punishment that disgraces him and who it is that is a liar. So wait and watch; surely I too am watching out with you.”
And when Our command came, We delivered Shuaib and those who had attained faith with him, by mercy from Us. And the Shout took away those who had done injustices, so they became motionless bodies in their homes
as if they had never prospered therein. Undoubtedly, away with Midian as was done away with Thamûd.
And very surely, We sent Moses with Our signs and an evident manifestation
to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and never was the command of Pharaoh prudent.
He precedes his people on the Day of Resurrection, and he led them into the Fire, and what a miserable drinking place to be led to!
And they were followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Resurrection; what a miserable gift to be gifted!
That is of the stories of the towns—We relate them to you; some are still standing and some have withered away.
And in no way did We do them any injustice, but to themselves they did injustice, so their gods whom they called upon apart from Allah availed them nothing when the command of your Lord arrived, and they did not increase them in anything but ruin.
And such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are unjust. His seizing is indeed most painful, most severe.
Indeed, in that is a sign for whoever fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day for which mankind will be gathered together, and that is a day to be witnessed,
and we only postpone it until a predetermined term.
On the day when it arrives, not a single self can speak without His leave, so some will be wretched and some will be happy.
So as for the wretched ones, they are in the Fire—they have therein sighing and gasping,
abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth remain, except as your Lord has willed. Indeed, your sg Lord is Doer of whatever He wants.
And as for the ones who have been granted happiness , they are in the Garden (of Paradise) , abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth remain, except as your Lord has willed—an uninterrupted grant.
So do not regard what these people worship with skepticism. They do not worship except as their fathers used to worship before, and most surely We will pay them their due in full, undiminished.
And indeed We already brought Moses the Scripture, but it was differed upon. And were it not for a word that had preceded from your Lord, judgment would have been decreed between them, and they are most surely in perplexing doubt concerning it.
 Yet indeed , to every one of them your Lord will certainly render in full (the reward) for their deeds; indeed, He is All-Aware of what they do.
So be sg upright as you have been commanded, along with whoever has repented with you, and do pl not exceed all limits; indeed, He is All-Seeing of what you do.
And do not rely on those who have done injustices or the Fire will touch you, and you will have no guardians apart from Allah, and you will not be supported.
And establish sg the prayer at both extremities of the day and in the early hours of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with evil deeds. That is a reminding for those who remember.
And be sg patient, for surely Allah does not waste the reward of those who excel in doing good.
So if only there were, among the generations before you pl , people with a remnant (of wisdom) forbidding corruption in the land, other than the few of them whom We saved. But the unjust ones pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, and thus became criminals.
And in no way would your Lord destroy towns unjustly while their inhabitants are reformers.
And had your sg Lord willed, He could have made mankind one community, but they continue to differ,
except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed mercy—and for that reason He created them. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled: “I will most surely fill Hell with (the race of) unseen beings and human beings, both together.”
And all what We relate to you of the stories of the messengers is to strengthen your heart therewith. And the truth has come to you in this, and an admonition and a reminder for the believers.
And say to those who do not believe, “Act according to your position ; surely, we are also acting (according to ours) .
And wait; indeed, we too are waiting.”
And to Allah belongs the hidden realm of the heavens and the earth, and to Him every matter is returned . So worship sg Him and place your trust in Him, for your Lord is not oblivious of what you pl do .
