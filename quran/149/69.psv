The Reality.
What is the Reality?
And what can make you sg realize what the Reality is?
Thamûd and ʻĀd disbelieved in the Shocking Event.
So as for Thamûd, they were annihilated by the Overwhelming.
And as for ʻĀd, they were annihilated by a furious, roaring wind
which He unleashed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so you sg could see the people tossed around as though they were stumps of hollow palm trees.
So can you sg see any remnant of them?
Then Pharaoh and whoever was before him and the Overturned Cities came up with grave offenses
and disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an overpowering grip.
Indeed, when the waters overflowed We carried you pl in the running ship,
making it a lesson for you pl —so that an attentive ear may take heed.
Then, when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast,
and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single crush—
on that day, the Inevitable Event shall come to pass
and the heaven shall crack, for on that day it shall be frail.
And the angels are ranged around its borders, while eight carry the Throne of your sg Lord above them on that day.
On that day you pl are presented, and no hidden secret of yours remains hidden.
So as for the one who was given his record in his right hand, he says, “Here, take my record and read it.
Indeed, I was certain that I would meet my reckoning.”
So he will be in a well-pleasing living,
in a lofty Garden (of Paradise) ,
its clusters (of fruit) within reach—
“Eat and drink with satisfaction on account of what you pl did in the days gone by.”
But as for the one who was given his record a in his left hand, he says, “I wish I was never given my record
and never knew what my reckoning was.
If only it was the end!
My money cannot avail me;
my power has vanished from me.”
“Take pl him and shackle him,
then scorch him in purgatory,
then in a chain whose length is seventy cubits tie him up.
For he would not believe in Allah, the Great,
nor would he urge (others to serve) food to the destitute sg .
So he has no intimate (friend) here today,
nor any food except scum,
which none eats except the wrongdoers.”
So I swear by what you pl see
and what you do not see:
it is indeed the word of a noble messenger
and in no way is it the word of a poet—little do you pl believe ,
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer—little do you remind yourselves .
 (It is) a bestowal from on high by the Lord of all realms.
And had he falsely attributed some statements to Us,
We would certainly have seized him strongly ,
then We would certainly have slashed his aorta,
and in no way could any of you have defended him.
And indeed, it is a reminding for the mindful pl (of God) .
And indeed, We do know that some of you are disbelievers.
And indeed, it is surely a source of grief for the deniers.
And indeed, it is surely the truth of certitude.
So highly exalt the name of your sg Lord, the Great.
