Have you  sg   seen the one who denies the Recompense  ?
It is the one who mistreats the orphan
and does not urge (others to serve)  food to the destitute  sg   .
So woe to the ones who prayâ€”
those who are heedless of their prayers,
those who make show (of their deeds)  
yet withhold (little)  kindnesses  .
