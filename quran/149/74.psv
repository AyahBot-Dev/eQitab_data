O you shrouded (in your mantle) —
stand up and warn!
And your sg Lord glorify!
And your sg clothes purify!
And abominations forsake sg !
And show sg no favor, seeking self-gain!
And to your sg Lord endure patiently!
So when the Trumpet is blown,
that day will be a difficult day
for the deniers—not easy.
Leave sg to Me the one whom I created alone,
and to whom I gave vast wealth
and children by his side,
and smoothed things for him—
yet he ardently hopes that I give more!
But no! He was stubborn towards Our signs 
I will exhaust him increasingly.
He thought and determined.
May he perish —how he determined!
Again: may he perish—how he determined!
Then he looked,
then he frowned and scowled,
then he retreated and acted arrogantly
and said, “This is nothing but sorcery from the past.
This is nothing but the word of a human being.”
I will roast him in Saqar .
But what can make you sg realize what Saqar is?
It neither leaves nor spares;
it scorches the flesh;
over it are nineteen.
And We have not appointed except angels to be wardens of the Fire and have made their number nothing but a means of trial for the deniers—so that those given the Scripture may attain certitude, and those who have attained belief may increase in faith, and those given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt, and so that those in whose hearts is sickness and the deniers may say, “What did Allah desire by this parable?” Thus Allah misguides whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills, and none knows the soldiers of your sg Lord except He, and this is nothing but a reminder to human beings.
But no! By the moon.
By the night as it retreated.
By the morning when it lights up—
indeed, it is one of the greatest things:
a warning to human beings,
to whomever of you who wishes to advance or regress.
Every single self is held in pledge for what it has earned,
except for those on the Right—
in Gardens (of Paradise) , inquiring
about the criminals:
“What drove you sg into Saqar?”
They said, “We were not of those who prayed,
nor did we feed the destitute sg ,
and we used to indulge (in falsehood) with those who indulged,
and we used to deny the Day of Recompense,
until the certitude (of death) came to us.”
So in no way can the intercession of intercessors help them.
So why are they disregarding the Reminder,
as though they were panicked donkeys ,
having fled from a lion?
Yet every one of them wants to be given scrolls unrolled.
But no! Rather, they do not fear the Hereafter.
But no! It is a Reminder.
So whoever wills shall remember it.
Yet they will not remember unless Allah wills; He is Worthy of mindfulness and Worthy of (bestowing) forgiveness.
