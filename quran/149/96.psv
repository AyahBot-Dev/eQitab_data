Recite: In the name of your  sg   Lord Who created—
created man from a clinging form.
Recite: And your  sg   Lord is the Most Noble,
the OneWho taught by the pen—
taught man what he never knew.
But no! Indeed, man surely exceeds all limits,
for he sees himself self-sufficient.
Indeed, to your  sg   Lord is the ultimate return.
Have you  sg   seen the one who forbids
a servant when he prays?
Have you  sg   seen whether he was rightly guided
or commanded to mindfulness (of God)  ?
Have you  sg   seen whether he disbelieved and turned away?
Has he not realized that Allah sees?
But no! Surely, if he does not desist, We will drag (him)  by the forelock—
a lying, wrongful forelock.
Let him call on his gang;
We will call the guards of Hell.
But no! Do not obey him, but prostrate yourself and draw near.
