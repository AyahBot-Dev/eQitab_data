By those who snatch violently .
By those who remove gently.
By those who glide smoothly,
and by those who race swiftly,
and by those who regulate matters—
on the day when the Quake quakes
and is followed by the Successor,
hearts on that day are pounding,
their sight (s) (subdued) in reverence.
They say, “ Can it be that we will really be restored to the original condition?
 Can that be when we have become worn out bones?”
They said , “This is a losing return.”
Yet, indeed, it is nothing but a single nudge,
and they are all awake.
Has the story of Moses reached you sg ?
When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa,
“Go to Pharaoh—indeed, he has exceeded all limits—
and say, ‘Do you sg care to be purified?
And I will guide you to your Lord, so you will be in awe.’”
So he showed him the biggest sign,
but he disbelieved and disobeyed,
then retreated in haste
and gathered and proclaimed.
He said, “I am your pl Lord, the most high.”
So Allah seized him with an exemplary punishment, in the Last (life) and in the First.
Indeed, in this is a lesson for whoever fears.
Are you pl more difficult to create or the heaven? He constructed it:
He raised its masses and proportioned it,
and He dimmed its night and brought out its daylight.
And the earth, after that—He spread it out;
from it He brought out its water and its pasture,
and the mountains He anchored—
a source of enjoyment for you pl and for your livestock.
So when the Biggest Catastrophe arrives—
on the day when man reminds himself of what he has endeavored,
and purgatory is displayed to whoever sees.
So as for the one who exceeded all
limits and preferred the Earlier Life,
then indeed, purgatory is the shelter.
But as for the one who feared standing before his Lord and forbade the self (its) whim,
then indeed, the Garden (of Paradise) is the shelter.
They ask you sg about the Hour: “When will it take place?”
What have you sg to do with mentioning it?
To your sg Lord is its finality.
You are just a forewarner for whoever fears it.
On the day when they witness it, it will be as though they tarried (in the world) but the evening of one day or its morning.
