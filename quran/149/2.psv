Alif Lām Mīm.
That is the Scripture; there is no doubt about it—a guidance for the mindful (of God)  ,  
who believe in the (existence of)  hidden realms and establish the prayers and spend out of what We have provided them,
and those who believe in what has been sent down to you  sg   and what has been sent down before you, and regarding the Hereafter they are certain.
Those are upon guidance from their Lord, and those are the successful.
Indeed, it is the same for those who have denied: whether you  sg   have warned them or have not warned them, they do not believe.
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight( s  )  is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.
And of mankind are those who say, “We have attained faith in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they are not believers.
They try to deceive Allah and those who have attained faith, yet they  deceive    none but themselves, but they are unaware.
In their hearts is sickness, so Allah increased their sickness, and for them is a painful punishment on account of how they used to  lie    .
And when it is said to them, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they say, “Indeed, we are only reformers.”
Undoubtedly, it is they who are indeed the corrupters, but they are unaware.
And when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Shall we believe as the fools have believed?” Undoubtedly, it is they who are indeed the fools, but they do not know.
And when they encounter those who have attained faith, they say, “We have attained faith.” But when they arealone with their Satans, they say, “We are indeed with you; we are only ridiculing.”
Allah ridicules them and gives them free rein to exceed all limits, wandering blindly.
Those are the ones who have purchased utter misguidance in exchange for guidance, so in no way has their bargain made any profit, and in no way have they been rightly guided.
Their likeness is that of a person who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away their  light and left them in darkness (es)    , unable to see.
Deaf, mute, blind, so they are not returning.
Or like a cloudburst from the sky in which are darkness (es)  and thunder and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears against the thunderbolts, in fear of death. Yet Allah is All-Encompassing of the deniers.
The lightning almost snatches their sight (s)  away; whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it. But when it darkens over them, they stand (still)  . And had Allah willed, He could have done away with their hearing and their sight( s  ). Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
O mankind, worship your Lord Who created you and those before you, that you may become mindful (of Him)  :
the One Who has made the land a habitat for you and the sky a structure, and has sent water down from the sky and has brought out products thereby as provision for you. So do not assign rivals to Allah while you know.
And if you  pl   are in doubt about what We have bestowed upon Our servant from on high, then bring a single surah  of its like, and call your witnesses apart from Allah if you are truthful.
But if you  pl   do not—and you will not—then be mindful of the Fire  whose fuel is people and stones; it has been prepared for the deniers.
And give  sg   glad tidings to those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with any produce therefrom as provision, they say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they are brought (them)  in (perfect)  resemblance. And for them are cleansed spouses therein, and therein they abide.
Indeed, Allah does not shy away from setting forth any parable, even of a gnat or anything above it. So as for those who have attained faith—they know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who have denied—they say, “What did Allah want (to say)  by this parable?” He misguides many thereby and He guides many thereby, but He does not misguide thereby except the defiantly disobedient
who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been pledged and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined and spread corruption in the earth—those are the losers.
How can you  pl   deny Allah when you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He puts you to death, then He brings you to life, then to Him  you are returned    ?
It is He Who created for you  pl   what is on earth, all together, then turned to the heaven and formed them  into seven heavens. And He is All-Knowing of everything.
And recall when your  sg   Lord said to the angels, “I am appointing a viceroy in the earth.” They said, “Will You appoint in it someone who causes corruption in it and sheds blood, while we highly exalt You with praise and proclaim Your holiness?” He said, “Indeed, I know what you do not know.”
And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He presented them to the angels and said, “Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.”
They said, “Highly Exalted be You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You Who are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”
He said, “O Adam, inform them of their names.” So when he informed them of their names, He said, “Did I not tell you  pl   that I know (all about)  the hidden realm of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you disclose and what you have been concealing?”
And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam”, so they prostrated themselves—but not Iblis  . He refused and acted arrogantly and became of the deniers.
Thereafter, We said, “O Adam, settle in the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat  dl   from it freely as you both will; but do not approach  dl   this tree, lest you  dl   become of the unjust.”
Yet Satan  made them slip    therefrom, so he brought them out of what they were in. Then We said, “Descend  pl   , as enemies to one another, for in the earth you  pl   have a place of settlement and enjoyment for a while.”
Thereupon Adam  received words    from his Lord. Thus, He granted him repentance and accepted it from him. Indeed, it is He Who is the Superb Granter and Accepter of repentance, the Bestower of mercy.
We said, “Descend from it, all together. Then whenever any guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance—then  no fear     shall be upon them  nor shall they grieve.
But those who have denied and disbelieved in Our signs—those are the fellows of the Fire; therein they abide.”
O Children of Israel, “Remember My blessing which I blessed you with and fulfill your (part of the)  covenant so that I fulfill My (part of the)  covenant, and fear Me alone.
And believe  pl   in what I have sent down, confirming what is with you  pl   . And do not be the first denier  of it, and do not purchase, inexchange for My revelations, a small price, and be mindful of Me alone.
And do not mix truth with falsehood, and do not conceal the truth while you  pl   know.
And establish the prayer, and bring  the purifying charity  , and bow down with the ones bowing down.
Do you  pl   command mankind to virtue and forget yourselves, even though you read the Scripture? Do you not reason?
And seek  pl   help through patience and prayer, and it is indeed a great burden except for the reverent
who are certain that they shall meet their Lord and that to Him they will return.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I blessed you, and that I favored you over all communities.
And be mindful of a day  when no self avails another in anything, nor is any intercession accepted on its behalf, nor is any ransom taken from it, nor are they  d    supported.
And recall how We delivered you  pl   from Pharaoh’s folk— (those)  inflicting  upon you an evil punishment, slaying your sons and keeping your women alive (in bondage)  . For therein is a great test from your Lord.
And recall how We parted the sea for you  pl   and (thus)  We saved you, and We drowned Pharaoh’s folk while you were beholding.
And recall when We appointed  with    Moses forty nights. Then you  pl   took the calf (for worship)  after him, while you were unjust.
Then We pardoned you after that, that you may give thanks.
And recall when We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion, that you  pl   may be guided.
And recall when Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have done injustice to yourselves by taking the calf (for worship)  . So repent to your Maker and kill yourselves  . That would be better for you with your Maker.” So He granted you repentance and accepted it from you; indeed it is He who is the Superb Granter and Accepter of repentance, the Bestower of mercy.
And recall when you  pl   said, “O Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see Allah plainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you while you were beholding.
Then We revived you  pl   after your death, that you may give thanks.
And We shaded you  pl   with mists, and We sent down manna and quails upon you: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” And in no way did they do injustice to Us, but they used to do injustice to themselves.
And recall when We said, “Enter this town and eat from it freely wherever you  pl   will, but enter the gate bowing down and say, ‘disburden (us)  ’.  We (will) forgive you your offenses    , and We will give more to those who excel in doing good.”
Then the ones who did injustice exchanged (it for)  a saying other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon the ones who did injustice a torment from heaven on account of how they used to defiantly disobey.
And recall how Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, “Strike the rock with your  sg   staff.” Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from it; each group of people certainly knew its drinking-place. “Eat  pl   and drink from Allah’s provision, and do not go wickedly about the land, corrupting (it)  .”
And recall when you  pl   said, “O Moses, we shall not endure one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to bring out for us of what the earth germinates: of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.” He said, “Would you  pl   exchange what is better for what is less? Go down to Egypt where you will have what you asked for.” And they  were struck with humiliation and destituteness, and they incurred wrath from Allah. That was because they used to deny Allah’s signs  and unjustifiably kill the prophets. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and those who have Judaized and the Christians and the Sabians—whoever has attained faith in Allah and the Last Day and has acted righteously—then their  reward is with their Lord, and  no fear     shall be upon them nor shall they grieve.
And recall when We took a pledge from you  pl   and raised Mount Tûr above you: “Take what We have given you firmly and remember what is in it, that you may become mindful (of God)  .”
But after that you  pl   turned away. So were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you would have been of the losers.
And you surely knew those of you who transgressed the Sabbath, so We said to them, “Be despicable apes!”
Thus We made it a deterrent for their generation and for subsequent generations, and a lesson for the mindful  pl    (of God)  .
And recall when Moses said to his people, “Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Do you make a mockery of us?” He said, “I seek refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant.”
They said, “Call upon your Lord to make evident to us what (sort of cow)  it is.” He said, “He says it is a cow neither too old nor too young—of median age between that, so do what you are commanded.”
They said, “Call upon your Lord to make evident to us what its color is.” He said, “Indeed, He says that it is surely a yellow cow, bright in color, pleasing to the beholders.”
They said, “Call upon your Lord to make evident to us what (sort of cow)  it is; surely all cows look alike to us and—if Allah wills— we shall most surely be guided.”
He said, “He says it is a cow neither yoked to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, sound without blemish.” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” So they slaughtered it, though they almost did not.
And recall when you  pl   killed a self then shifted responsibility for it onto each other, but Allah was to bring out (to the open)  what you were concealing.
So We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus Allah brings the dead to life, and He shows you  pl   His signs, that you may reason.
Then after that your hearts hardened, so that they were as rocks or even harder. For surely from some rocks rivers gush out, and surely some others splinter so that water comes out from them, and surely some others sink in awe of Allah. And Allah is never oblivious of what  you     do .
Do you  pl   ardently hope that they will believe you, when a group of them used to hear the Speech of Allah and then distort it after they had reasoned, knowingly?
And when they encounter those who have attained faith, they say, “We have attained faith.” But when they come together privately, they say, “Do you  pl   inform them of what Allah has disclosed to you so that they might debate you concerning it before your Lord?” Do you not reason?
Do they not know that Allah knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public?
And among them  are illiterates who do not know the Scripture, other than fancies, and they only speculate.
So woe to those who scribe the Scripture with their own hands and then say, “This is from Allah,” that they may purchase, in exchange for it, a small price. Woe to them on account of what their hands have written, and woe to them on account of what they earn  .
And they said, “The Fire will not touch us except for a few days.” Say  sg   , “Have you  pl   taken a covenant from Allah—so Allah will never break His covenant—or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?”
Yes indeed, whoever has earned an evil deed and whose  offense has    surrounded him—then those are the fellows of the Fire; therein they abide.
But those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—those are the fellows of the Garden (of Paradise)  ; therein they abide.
And recall when We took a pledge from the Children of Israel: “ You     shall worship none but Allah, and excel in showing kindness to the parents and the relative and orphans and the destitute  pl   , and say kind words to mankind and establish the prayers and bring  the purifying charity  .” Then you  turned away in disregard, except for a few of you.
And recall when We took a pledge from you  pl   : “You shall not shed your blood nor evict yourselves from your homes.” Then you consented while you were witnessing.
Then here you are, killing yourselves and evicting a group of your own from their homes—backing each other against them in sin and hostility. And if they come to you as captives, you  do ransom    them, while their eviction is forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part of the Scripture and deny part? So what is the repayment for those of you who do that but disgrace in the Earlier Life, and (that)  on the Day of Resurrection they are turned back to the most severe punishment? For Allah is never oblivious of what  you     do .
Those are the ones who purchased the Earlier Life in exchange for the Hereafter, so the punishment is not lightened for them nor are they to be supported.
And most surely, We brought Moses the Scripture and sent a succession of messengers after him. And We brought Jesus, son of Mary, the evident proofs, and We aided him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that every time a messenger came to you with anything your (inner)  selves do not desire, you acted arrogantly, so one group you disbelieved, and another group you kill  ?
And they said, “Our hearts are enfolded.” Rather, Allah has cursed them for their denial, so little do they believe.
For when a scripture came to them from Allah, confirming what they had—although previously they were seeking a conquest against those who denied—but when there came to them what they recognized, they denied it. So may Allah’s curse be upon the deniers.
Miserable is what they have purchased in exchange for their (very)  selves—that they deny what Allah has  bestowed from on high    , out of resentment that Allah would send down His grace upon whomever He wills of His servants. Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath, for for the deniers is a demeaning punishment.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down,” they say, “We believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny anything beyond that, although it is the truth which confirms what they have. Say  sg   , “Why (then)  do you kill  Allah’s prophets—earlier—if you are believers?”
And very truly Moses came to you  pl   with the evident proofs, then you took the calf (for worship)  after him while you were unjust.
And recall when We took a pledge from you  pl   and raised Mount Tûr above you: “Take what We have given you firmlyand hear.” They said, “We have heard and disobeyed.” And, on account of their denial, in their hearts they were soaked in (the worship of)  the calf. Say  sg   , “How miserable is that which your  pl   faith commands you to do, if you are believers.”
Say  sg   , “If the Home of the Hereafter with Allah is for you  pl   alone apart from all mankind, then wish for death if you are truthful.”
But they will never wish for it, on account of what their hands have put forth. For Allah is All-Knowing of the unjust.
And you  sg   will most surely find them the most adhering of mankind to life, and more so than those who associated (others with God)  . Every one of them would love to have his life extended a thousand years, but being granted a long life does not nudge him from the punishment, for Allah is All-Seeing of what  they     do .
Say  sg   , “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel…  —for indeed, it is he who has bestowed it upon your  sg   heart from on high by Allah’s leave, confirming what preceded it, and guidance and glad tidings for the believers.”
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael—then surely Allah is an enemy to the deniers.
And We have indeed sent down to you  sg   evident signs, and none denies them except the defiantly disobedient.
Is it not that whenever they make a covenant, a group of them throws it away? In fact, most of them do not believe.
For when a messenger from Allah came to them confirming what they had, a group of those who were given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know,
and they followed what the devils read  during the reign of Solomon. But never did Solomon deny  ; rather it was the Satans who denied, teaching people sorcery and what was sent down in Babylon to the two angels Harut and Marut. And they do not teach anybody until they say, “We are but a means of trial, so do not deny (faith)  .” Even so, they learn from them the means to cause separation between a man and his spouse—but never could they harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. And they learn what would harm them and not benefit them. Yet they did know that whoever purchased it  would have no share in the Hereafter. So indeed, how miserable is what they sold themselves for, if they only knew!
And had they attained faith and been mindful (of God)  , then surely a requital from Allah would have been better, if they only knew.
O you who have attained faith, do not say ‘Raʻina,’  but say, ‘Unthurna,’  and listen, for for the deniers is a painful punishment.
Neither the deniers from among the People of the Scripture nor the polytheists would love that any good be  sent down upon you     from your  pl   Lord. Yet Allah specifies for His mercy whomever He wills, for Allah is the Possessor of great grace.
Never do We  abrogate    any sign  nor  cause it to be forgotten    unless We bring one better than it or similar to it. Have you  sg   not come to know that Allah is All-Powerful over everything?
Have you  sg   not come to know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? For apart from Allah you  pl   have neither ally nor supporter.
Or do you  pl   want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned earlier? For whoever substitutes denial for faith, then he has certainly strayed from the right way.
Many of the People of the Scripture would love to turn you  pl   back into deniers after you have attained faith, out of envy in their (inner)  selves, after the truth has become evident to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah brings about His command. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
And establish the prayer and bring  the purifying charity  , for whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.
And they said, “None will enter the Garden (of Paradise)  unless he has been a Jew or a Christian.” These are their fancies. Say  sg   , “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”
Yes indeed, whoever submits his face (in worship)  to Allah while excelling in doing good, then he has his reward with his Lord, and  no fear     shall be upon them  nor shall they grieve.
Nevertheless, the Jews said, “Christians have no ground whatsoever to stand on,” while the Christians said, “Jews have no ground whatsoever to stand on.” Yet they read the Scripture. Similarly, the ones who do not know said the like of their saying. Thus Allah judges between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding whatever they differed over.
And who is more unjust than one who prevented (praying in)  the mosques of Allah so that His Name be not mentioned in them, and pursued their ruin? Those—never was it for them to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in the Earlier (Life)  , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
And to Allah belong the East and the West, so wherever you  pl   turn, then that is where Allah’s Countenance is. Indeed, Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
 And they     said , “Allah has taken (for Himself)  offspring.” Highly Exalted is He. Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth; all are devout towards Him—
the Innovator of the heavens and the earth, and whenever He decrees a matter, He only says to it,  “Be,” and so it is    .
And those who do not know said, “If only Allah would speak to us, or a sign would come to us.” Thus said those who were before them—just what they said. Their hearts are alike. We have certainly made the signs evident for people who are certain.
We have indeed sent you with the truth as a herald of glad tidings and as a warner,  for you will not be asked    about the fellows of purgatory.
And never will the Jews or the Christians be pleased with you  sg   until you follow their creed. Say, “Surely, Allah’s guidance is the Guidance.” And should you  sg   follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you, you would have against Allah neither ally nor supporter.
Those to whom We have brought the Scripture read it as it ought to be read; those ones believe in it. But  whoever denies it—then those  are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I have blessed you and that I have favored you over all communities.
And be  pl   mindful of a day  when no self avails any other self in anything, nor is any ransom accepted from it, nor does any intercession benefit it, nor are they  b    supported.
And recall when  Abraham    was tried by his Lord with certain words and he fulfilled them. He said, “I am appointing you as a leader for mankind.” He said, “And of my offspring?” He said, “My covenant does not include the unjust  pl   .”
And recall when We made the House a resort for mankind, and a sanctuary. And     take   pl   from  Abraham’s   e   standing place a place of prayer. And We covenanted with Abraham and Ishmael, “Cleanse My House for circumambulators and consecrators and those bowing down and prostrating themselves.”
And recall when Abraham said, “Lord! Make this a secure land and provide its people with products—whoever of them has attained faith in Allah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever denies—I will give him a little enjoyment, then compel him to the punishment of the Fire, and what a miserable destiny!”
And recall  Abraham   d   raising the foundations of the House together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, accept (it)  from us; indeed, it is You, You (alone)  , who are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Our Lord, and make us both Muslim  to You, and from our offspring a Muslim community (submitting)  to You. And show us our rites, and grant us repentance and accept it from us; indeed, it is You, You (alone)  who are the Superb Granter and Accepter of repentance, the Bestower of mercy.
Our Lord, and send forth among them a messenger from themselves to read to them Your signs  and teach them the Scripture and the wisdom and purify them. Indeed, it is you, You (alone)  , who are the Almighty, the All-Wise.”
And who would forsake the creed of  Abraham    except he who fools himself? And We have indeed chosen him in the Earlier (Life)  , and in the Hereafter he is most surely one of the righteous.
Recall when his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He said, “I have submitted to the Lord of all realms.”
And with this  Abraham   b    frequently  enjoined    his children, and (so did)  Jacob, “O my children, Allah has indeed chosen the religion for you, so do not die except as Muslims  .”
Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, and he said to his children, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers,  Abraham   b   , Ishmael and Isaac: One God, and to Him we are Muslims  d   .”
That is a nation that has passed. For them is what they have earned, and for you is what you  pl   have earned, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
And they said, “Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided.” Say  sg   , “Rather, the creed of Abraham who turned away from all that is false, for never was he of the polytheists.”
Say  pl   , “We have attained faith in Allah and in what was sent down to us, and in what was sent down to  Abraham   b   and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Grandsons, and in what was brought to Moses and Jesus, and in what was brought to the prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, for to Him we are Muslims.”
So if they believe in the same as you  pl   have believed in, then they have been guided. But if they turn away, then they are in discord. And Allah will protect you against them, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
 (It is)  Allah’s hue. And who gives a better hue than Allah? “And of Him we are worshipers.”
Say  sg   , “Do you debate with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and when for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds, and to Him we are sincere?”
Or do  you     say   pl   that  Abraham    and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Grandsons  were Jews or Christians? Say  sg   , “Do you know better or Allah?” And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? For Allahis not oblivious of what you  pl   do.
That is a community that has passed away. For them is what they have earned and for you  pl   is what you have earned, for you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
The fools among mankind will say, “What has turned them away from the direction of prayer that they used to follow?” Say  sg   , “To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.”
And thus have We made you a middle community, that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. Thus We only assigned the direction of prayer, which you formerly followed, that We may distinguish the one who follows the Messenger from the one who turns on his heels. And it was indeed difficult, except for those whom Allah has guided. But never would Allah let your faith  go to waste; indeed, towards mankind, Allah has always been truly Compassionate, Bestowing of mercy.
We have surely seen the turning about of your  sg   face towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a direction that pleases you. So turn your face towards the Inviolable Mosque. And wherever you  pl   may be, turn your faces  towards it. Indeed, those who were brought the Scripture know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not oblivious of what  they     do .
And indeed, even if you  sg   were to come with every sign to those whom the Scripture was brought to, they would not follow your direction of prayer, nor are you to follow their direction of prayer, nor do they follow the direction of prayer of one another. For if you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you, you would most surely be, in that case, one of the unjust.
Those whom We have brought the Scripture recognize him  as they recognize their own children. But indeed a group of them do conceal the truth while they know.
The truth is from your  sg   Lord, so never be of the skeptics.
Thus for each is a direction towards which  he turns    , so race  pl   towards good works. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you all together. Allah is indeed Powerful over everything.
And from wherever you  sg   set out, turn your face towards the Inviolable Mosque, for this is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not oblivious of what  you     do   pl   .
And from wherever you  sg   set out, turn your face towards the Inviolable Mosque. And wherever you  pl   may be, turn your faces towards it so that people may not have any argument against you—except those of them who have been unjust. So do not fear them, but fear Me—and so that I may perfect My blessing upon you  pl   , and that you may be guided.
Just as We sent among you a messenger from yourselves, reading Our signs  to you, and purifying you, and teaching you the Scripture and wisdom, and teaching you what you did not know.
So remember Me (and)  I will remember you  pl   . And thank Me, and do not deny Me.
O you who have attained faith, seek help through patience and prayers. Indeed, Allah is with the patient ones.
And do not say  pl   of anyone who is killed in the way of Allah, “ (They are)  dead  .” Rather, (they are)  alive, but you are unaware.
And We will certainly test you  pl   with some fear and hunger and shortage of wealths and lives and products. Thus give  sg   glad tidings to the patient ones:
those who, when a calamity afflicts them, say, “To Allah we belong, and indeed to Him we are returning.”
Upon those are pardons and mercy from their Lord, and those are the rightly guided.
Indeed, Al-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the rites of Allah, so whoever performs Pilgrimage  to the House or performs Minor Pilgrimage  , then no sin is committed by him if he circumambulates them. And whoever volunteers a good act—then Allah is indeed Thankful, All-Knowing.
Indeed, those who conceal what We have sent down of evident proofs and guidance after We had made it evident for mankind in the Scripture—those—Allah curses them and the cursers curse them,
except those who have repented and reformed and made (the truth)  evident. For those—I grant them repentance and accept it from them, for I am the Superb Granter and Accepter of repentance, the Bestower of mercy.
Indeed, those who have denied and have died as deniers—those—upon themis the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind,
abiding therein; never is the punishment lightened for them, nor are they given respite.
For your  pl   God is One God. There is no God but He, the All-Merciful, the Bestower of mercy.
Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the ships that sail the sea with what benefits mankind, and the water that Allah sent down from the sky— with which He revived the earth after it had died and scattered in it all kinds of treading creatures, and the shifting of the  winds    , and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth are surely signs for people who reason.
Yet of mankind is one who takes (others)  apart from Allah as rivals to Him. They  love them with a love like that due to Allah, yet those who have attained faith are stronger in love for Allah. And if only  those who have done injustice could see    , when they  see    the punishment,  that    all power belongs to Allah and  that Allah is severe in punishment.
Recall when those who were followed disowned  those who had followed (them)  , and they saw the punishment and ties between them were severed.
And those who followed said, “If only we could have another chance so we could disown them as they disowned us.” Thus Allah shows  them their deeds as regrets to them, and never will they come out of the Fire.
O mankind, eat of what is lawful and good on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; indeed, he is to you an evident enemy.
He only commands you  pl   to evil and obscenity, and to say about Allah what you do not know.
And when it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “Rather, we follow what we found our forefathers following. What if their forefathers used not to reason anything nor to seek guidance?
The parable of those who have denied is that of one  who hollers out to things that hear nothing but mere calls and cries. Deaf, dumb, (and)  blind, so they do not reason.
O you who have attained faith, eat of the good things We have provided you, and give thanks to Allah  if it is He that you worship.
He has only forbidden you  pl   carrion and blood and the flesh of swine and what was dedicated to other than Allah. But if anyone is compelled without seeking (it)  or exceeding (the limits)  , he commits no sin. Indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Indeed, those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Scripture and purchase, in exchange for it, a small price—those devour nothing into their bellies but fire. And Allah does not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor does He purify them, for for them is a painful punishment.
Those are the ones who have purchased utter misguidance in exchange for guidance, and punishment in exchange for forgiveness. So how patient are they in the face of the Fire!
That is because Allah has bestowed the Scripture from on high with the truth. And most surely, those who differed over the Scripture are in profound discord.
Virtue is not (attained)  by turning your  pl   faces towards the East and the West. Rather, virtue is (exemplified)  in one who has attained faith in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets, and has brought money—despite his love of it—to relatives and orphans and the destitute  pl   and the traveler in need and the askers and for (the freeing of)  slaves  , and has established the prayer and brought  the purifying charity  ; and (it is exemplified)  in those  who fulfill their covenant when they have covenanted, and those who are patient in (the face of)  misery and adversity and at the time of battle. Those are the ones who were truthful, and it is those who are the mindful (of God)  .
O you who have attained faith, fair retribution for the murdered  pl   has been prescribed upon you: the free for the free, and the bondman for the bondman, and the female for the female. Yet whoever is somewhat pardoned by his brother (in faith)  , then this shall be adhered to in accordance with what is fair, and the payment back to him should be in a good way. That is lightening from your Lord and mercy. But whoever transgresses after that—then for him is a painful punishment.
Thus there is life for you in fair retribution, O people of understanding, that you may be mindful (of God)  .
It has been prescribed upon you: when death comes to one of you, if he is leaving wealth, (to bequeath)  a bequest in favor of the parents and close relatives in accordance with what is fair—a duty upon the mindful  pl    (of God)  .
But whoever changes it  after he has heard it, then surely its sin is upon those who change it. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Yet whoever fears unfairness or sin from a bequether, so he reconciles between them, then he commits no sin. Indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
O you who have attained faith, fasting has been prescribed upon you as it was prescribed upon those before you, that you may become mindful (of God)  .
 (This fasting is for)  a limited number of days. But should any one of you be sick or on a journey, then (he should fast)  a period of other days. Yet for those who can fast with difficulty  ,  a compensation (is allowed instead) —food for a destitute person    . But whoever volunteers a good act, it is better for him. Yet to fast is better for you  pl   , if you only knew.
 (It was)  the month of Ramadan in which the Recital  was sent down as guidance for mankind, and as evident explanations of the guidance and the criterion. So whoever of you witnesses the month, then he shall fast it. But whoever is sick or on a journey, then (he must fast)  a period of other days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you, and that you should complete the period, and that you should glorify Allah for having guided you, and so that you may give thanks.
And when My servants ask you  sg   about Me—indeed, I am near; I respond to the call of the caller when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me and let them have faith in Me, that they may become prudent.
Permitted for you  pl   is intercourse with your women on the night of the fast; they are a garment for you and you are a garment for them. Allah has known that you used to betray yourselves, but He granted you repentance and accepted it from you and pardoned you. So approach them now and seek what Allah has prescribed for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becomes evident to you from the black thread at dawn, then complete the fast to the night. But do not approach them while you are consecrating yourselves in the mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do not come near them. Allah thus clarifies His signs to mankind, that they may become mindful (of Him)  .
And do not devour your wealths among yourselves by false means, nor throw it (as bribes)  to the judges in order to devour part  of other people’s wealth illicitly, while you know.
They ask you  sg   about the crescents. Say, “They are time-marks for mankind and for the Pilgrimage  .” And virtue is not (attained)  by approaching houses from their backs; rather, virtue is (exemplified in)  one who has been mindful (of God)  . So approach houses from their doors  and be mindful of Allah, that you  pl   may succeed.
And combat in the way of Allah those who combat you  pl   , but do not start hostilities; indeed, Allah does not love the hostile ones.
And kill them wherever you  pl   encounter them, and evict them from where they have evicted you, for religious persecution is more severe than killing. But do not  combat    them at the Inviolable Mosque unless they  combat you about it. So if they  combat you  pl   , then kill them. Such is the repayment of the deniers.
But if they cease, then Allah is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And combat  pl   them until there is no more religious persecution and religion becomes for Allah. But if they cease, then let there be no hostility except against the unjust  pl   .
An inviolable month for an inviolable month, and inviolable rites call for fair retribution. So whoever starts hostilities against you  pl   , be hostile to him in the same measure as he has been hostile to you. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with the mindful  pl    (of Him)  .
And spend in the way of Allah and do not cast your  pl   own hands into annihilation, and excel in doing good. Indeed, Allah loves those who excel in doing good.
And complete the Pilgrimage  and the Minor Pilgrimage  for Allah. But if you  pl   are detained, then (offer)  whatever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave your heads until the offering has reached its destination. But whoever of you is sick or has some affliction of his head, then the due redemption is fasting or a donation or a sacrifice. Then when you are secure: whoever enjoys a break between the Minor Pilgrimage and the Pilgrimage, then (he must offer)  whatever is feasible of offering. But whoever cannot find the means, then fasting for three days during the Pilgrimage, and seven when you  pl   have  returned; that is ten in total. That is for the one whose family is not present at the Inviolable Mosque  . And be  pl   mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is stern in retribution.
Pilgrimage is during specific months. So whoever decides to perform Pilgrimage, then there shall  never be intercourse nor ungodliness nor disputation    during the Pilgrimage. And whatever good you  pl   do, Allah knows it. And take provisions, but the best provision is indeed mindfulness (of God)  . And be mindful of Me  , O people of understanding.
You  pl   commit no sin   by seeking grace from your Lord  . So when you  pl   pour forth from Arafat, remember Allah at the Sacred Landmark. And remember Him as He has guided you  pl   , although before that, you were indeed of those astray.
Then pour  pl   forth from where the people have poured forth and ask Allah for forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Then when you  pl   have completed your rites, remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with even greater remembrance. And of mankind is one who says, “Our Lord, bring to us in the Earlier (Life)  ,” yet he has no share in the Hereafter.
And of them is one who says, “Our Lord, bring to us goodness in the Earlier (Life)  and goodness in the Hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”
Those shall have a share of what they have earned, for Allah is Swift in reckoning.
And remember  pl   Allah  during a limited number of days. But whoever hurries on (to leave Mena)  after two days commits no sin, and whoever stays on commits no sin—provided he maintains mindfulness (of God)  . And be  pl   mindful of Allah, and know that to Him you will be herded.
And of mankind is one whose speech about the Earlier Life impresses you  sg   , and he calls upon Allah to bear witness as to what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.
For when he turns away (from you)  , he rushes about in the land in order to spread corruption on earth and destroy both field and progeny. But Allah does not love corruption.
And when he is told, “Be mindful of Allah,” the might of the sin takes over him. So Hell is sufficient for him, and indeed, what a miserable resting place!
And of mankind is one who sells his (inner)  self, seeking Allah’s pleasure. And Allah is Compassionate towards the servants.
O you who have attained faith, enter into peacefulness and submission collectively, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; indeed, to you he is an evident enemy.
So if you  pl   slip after the evident proofs have come to you, then know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
Are they waiting for anything except for (the command of)  Allah to come to them in shades of  mists, and the angels (too)  ? And (thus)  the matter was  settled, for to Allah all things  are returned    .
Ask the Children of Israel how many an evident sign We brought them. Yet whoever changes the blessing of Allah after it has come to him, then Allah is indeed stern in retribution.
The Earlier Life has been adorned for those who have denied, and they ridicule those who have attained faith. But those who are mindful (of God)  are above them on the Day of Resurrection, for Allah provides to whomever He wills without measure.
Mankind used to be one community, then Allah sent the prophets as bearers of glad tidings and as forewarners. And He sent down with them the Scripture with the truth  to judge    between mankind regarding whatever they differed over. But none differed over it  except those who were given it—after evident proofs had come to them—out of mutual envy between them. Then Allah guided those who attained faith to the truth they had disputed, by His knowledge  . For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.
Or did you  pl   expect to enter the Garden (of Paradise)  before the like of (the trials that befell)  those who passed on before you had befallen you? Misery and adversity afflicted them, and they were shaken as with an earthquake,  until    the Messenger and those who believed with him would say, “When is Allah’s support (coming)  ?” Undoubtedly, Allah’s support is indeed near.
They ask you  sg   what they should spend. Say, “Whatever good (offering)  you spend is for the parents and the close relatives and the orphans and the destitute  pl   and the traveler in need. For whatever good you  pl   do, Allah is All-Knowing of it.
Combat has been prescribed upon you  pl   , even though you dislike it. But it may be that you  pl   dislike something while it is good for you, and it may be that you like something while it is bad for you. For Allah knows, and you  pl   know not.
They ask you  sg   about the inviolable month— (about)  combat during it. Say, “Combat during it is (a)  grave (offense)  , yet barring (others)  from the way of Allah and denying Him and (preventing access to)  the Inviolable Mosque as well as evicting its people from it are graver to Allah, for religious persecution is (a)  graver (offense)  than killing. And they will keep combating you  pl   to turn you back from your religion, if they can. And whoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a denier—those  are the ones whose deeds were nullified in the Earlier (Life)  and the Hereafter, for those are the fellows of the Fire; therein they abide.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and those who have migrated and have striven in the way of Allah—those expect Allah’s mercy, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
They ask you  sg   about wine and gambling. Say, “There is  grave sin    in them and some benefits for people, but the sin in them  is greater than their benefit.” And they ask you about what they should spend. Say, “The surplus.” Thus Allah makes the sign evident to you  pl   , that you may reflect
about the Earlier (Life)  and the Hereafter. And they ask you  sg   about (looking after)  orphans. Say, “Reforming their affairs is best. And if you intermix with them, then they are your brethren.” And Allah knows the corrupter from the reformer. For had Allah willed, He could have overburdened you  pl   . Indeed, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
Moreover, do  pl   not marry polytheistic women until they believe, for a believing bondwoman is surely better than a polytheistic woman, even if she impresses you  pl   . And do not marry your women to polytheistic men until they believe, for a believing bondman is surely better than a polytheistic man, even if he impresses you  pl   . Those call to the Fire, while Allah calls to the Garden (of Paradise)  and to forgiveness by His leave, for He makes clear His signs to mankind, that they may remember.
And they ask you  sg   about menstruation. Say, “It is (a cause of)  harm, so keep  pl   away from (sexual intercourse with)  women during menstruation, and do not approach them until they are clean    . But once they have cleansed themselves, then approach them from where Allah has commanded you.” Indeed, Allah loves those who frequently repent, and He loves those who cleanse themselves.”
Your  pl   women are a field for you, so approach your fields whichever way you like, but do some (good)  act for yourselves beforehand. And be mindful of Allah and know that you  pl   are bound to meet Him. And give  sg   glad tidings to the believers.
And do not make your oaths in Allah’s name an excuse to hinder you  pl   from virtue and mindfulness (of God)  and reconciling between people, for Allah is All-Listening, All-Knowing.
Allah does not hold you  pl   accountable for idle talk involving your (unintended)  oaths, but He holds you accountable for what your hearts have earned, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Forbearing.
For those who vow abstinence from their wives is a wait of four months. But if they retract, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
But if they resolve to divorce—then Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Moreover, divorced women shall keep themselves in wait for three periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day, for their husbands have the right to restore them back if they want reconciliation. And women have rights equal to their obligations in accordance with what is fair. But men have a degree over them, for Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
Divorce is (allowed)  twice, then either retention in accordance with what is fair, or setting free kindly. And it is not lawful for you  pl   to take back anything you have given them  , unless  they     both fear     that they may not maintain Allah’s limits. So if you  pl   fear that they may not maintain Allah’s limits, then there is no sin committed by either of them if she pays, as a compensation for her release  . These are Allah’s limits, so do  pl   not transgress them, for those who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
But if he divorces her, she shall not be lawful for him again until she has married another spouse. Then if he   divorces her, then no sin is committed by them both  if they reunite, provided they think they can maintain Allah’s limits. Thus these are Allah’s limits; He makes them evident to people who know.
Thus if you  pl   divorce women and they have reached their term  , then either retain them in accordance with what is fair or release them in accordance with what is fair. But do not retain them in order to transgress against them, for whoever performs that, then he has surely been unjust to himself. And do not take Allah’s signs for mockery. And remember Allah’s blessing upon you  pl   and what He has sent down to you of the Scripture and the Wisdom to admonish you. And be  pl   mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.
Thus if you  pl   divorce women and they have reached their term  g   , then do not prevent them from marrying their spouses (again)  , provided they agree with each other in accordance with what is fair. That is an admonition for whoever of you believes in Allah and the Last Day. That is more purifying for you  pl   and cleaner, for Allah knows, and you know not.
And mothers shall nurse their children for two whole years  —for whoever wants to complete the nursing period. And it is the duty of the father of the infant to provide for them  and clothe them in accordance with what is fair. No self shall be tasked beyond its capacity. No mother  should be    harmed on account of her child, nor any father of an infant on account of his child. And the same duty rests upon the heir. And if they both want weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, then no sin is committed by them. And if you  pl   want  to seek nursing for your children, then no sin is committed by you as long as you give (them)  what you  have brought    in accordance with what is fair. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is indeed All-Seeing of what you do.
And those of you who are taken at death and leave spouses behind, they  shall keep themselves in wait for four months and ten days. Then when they have reached their term, then no sin is committed by you  pl   regarding what they might do with themselves in accordance with what is fair. For Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
And no sin is committed by you  pl   if you give a hint about engagement to (the widowed)  women or if you keep it within yourselves. Allah already knew that you would consider (marrying)  them  . But do not meet them secretly unless you have something to say in accordance with what is fair. And do not confirm the marriage tie until the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah knows what is in your (inner)  selves, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Forbearing.
No sin is committed by you  pl   if you divorce women before  having touched     them    nor appointed to them any marriage obligation  . And compensate them: the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means—a compensation in accordance with what is fair, a duty upon those who excel in doing good.
But if you  pl   divorce them before having touched them and you have already appointed them an appointed sum, then (give them)  half of what you have appointed—unless they waive it or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract waives it. But to waive it is nearer to mindfulness (of God)  . And do not forget grace among yourselves. Indeed, Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.
Preserve  pl   the prayers and the middle prayer, and stand devout before Allah.
But if you  pl   are in fear, then (pray)  on foot or while riding. Then when you feel secure, remember Allah as He has taught you what you did not know.
Moreover, those of you (men)  who are taken at death and leave spouses behind—(let them bequeath) a bequest    for their spouses with compensation for a year without eviction (from the husband’s residence)  . But if they depart, then no sin is committed by you  pl   regarding what they have done with themselves in accordance with what is fair. For Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
And for divorced women there is a compensation in accordance with what is fair—a duty upon the mindful  pl   .
Allah thus makes His signs evident to you  pl   , that you may reason.
Have you  sg   not seen those who departed their homes by the thousands, for fear of death? So Allah said to them, “Die,” then He revived them. Most surely, Allah is Gracious towards mankind, but most of mankind do not thank.
And combat  pl   in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Who is it that will lend Allah a good  loan? (So) that He may multiply it for him manifold     , for Allah withholds and extends, and to Him  you   pl    are returned    .
Have you  sg   not seen the chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint a king for us, and we will combat in the way of Allah.”? He said, “Would you perhaps, in case combat is prescribed upon you, not combat?” They said, “Why would we not combat in the way of Allah when we were evicted from our homes along with our children?” But when combat was prescribed upon them, they turned away, except for a few of them. For Allah is All-Knowing of the unjust  pl   .
Thus their prophet said to them, “Indeed, Allah has sent you Talut  as a king.” They said, “How can he have authority over us when we are more worthy of authority than he, for he was not brought abundance of wealth?” He said, “Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him in knowledge and build.” Thus Allah brings His authority to whomever He wills, for Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
And their prophet said to them, “Indeed, the sign of his authority is that the ark  shall come to you with tranquility from your Lord, and relics left by Moses’s folk and Aaron’s folk. (It shall be)  carried by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you have been believers.”
So when Talut  a   set out with the troops, he said, “Allah will indeed be testing you with a river. So whoever drinks from it does not belong with me, but whoever does not taste it does belong with me—except for whoever scoops up  a scoopful    with his hand.” Yet they drank from it, except for a few of them. Then when he had crossed it together with those who had attained faith with him, they said, “We have no strength to face Galut  and his troops today.” Those expecting to meet Allah said, “How many a small battalion has overcome a large battalion by Allah’s leave, for Allah is with the patient ones.”
And when they confronted Galut  d   and his troops, they said, “Our Lord, pour down patience upon us and strengthen our foothold and support us against the denying people.”
So they defeated them by Allah’s leave when David killed Galut  d   , and Allah brought him authority and wisdom and taught him as He willed. And were it not for Allah  repelling    some people by means of others, the earth would indeed become corrupted, but Allah is Gracious to all realms.
Those are Allah’s signs  which We read to you in truth, for you are most surely one of the emissaries.
Those messengers—we favored some of them over others of them: to some of them Allah spoke (directly)  , and some of them He elevated by degrees. And We  brought Jesus, son of Mary, the evident proofs, and We aided him with the Holy Spirit. And had Allah willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought one another after the evident proofs had come to them, but they disputed—for some of them attained faith and some of them denied. For had Allah willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He wants.
O you who have attained faith, spend from what We have provided for you before there comes a day in which there is neither trading nor close friendship nor intercession, for the deniers are the unjust.
Allah—there is no god but He, the Living, the All-Sustaining. Neither slumber overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Who is it who can intercede with Him except by His leave? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not encompass any of His knowledge except according to what He wills. His knowledge  has embraced the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not fatigue Him, for He is the All-High, the Great.
 (There shall be)  no compulsion in religion; prudence has henceforth become distinct from delusion. So whoever denies false masters and attains faith in Allah, then he has truly grasped the firmest handhold which never fractures. For Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Allah is the Ultimate Guardian of those who have attained faith; He brings them out of the darkness (es)  into the light, while those who have denied—their guardians are the false masters; they bring them out of the light into the darkness (es)  . Those are the fellows of the Fire; therein they abide.
Have you  sg   not seen the one who debated  Abraham    about his Lord—that Allah had given him authority? Recall when  Abraham   c   said, “My Lord is the One Who gives life and causes death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.”  Abraham   c   said, “But surely, Allah brings the sun from the East, so you bring it from the West.” Thus the denier was confounded, for Allah does not guide the unjust  pl   .
Or like the one who passed by a town and it was completely devastated upon its trellises. He said, “How can Allah revive this after its death?” Thereupon Allah caused him to die for a hundred years and then resurrected him. He said, “For how long have you tarried?” He said, “I have tarried for a day or part of a day.” He said, “Rather, you have tarried for a hundred years. And look at your food and your drink—it has not spoiled—and look at your donkey. And We will make you a sign for mankind. And look at the bones—how We  assemble    them, then clothe them with flesh.” So when it became evident to him,  he said, “I know    that Allah is All-Powerful over everything.”
And recall when  Abraham    said, “My Lord, show me how You revive the dead  pl   .” He said, “Have you not attained faith?” He said, “Yes indeed, but that my heart may become serene.” He said, “So take four birds and bend them towards you  , then place on every mountain a part of them, then call them and they will come to you, running. And know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.”
The parable of those who spend their wealths in the way of Allah is that of a grain that has germinated seven ears; in each ear are a hundred grains. For Allah multiplies for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Those who spend their wealths in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with any reminder  or any harm—their reward is with their Lord, and  no fear     shall be upon them nor shall they grieve.
A kind word and forgiveness are better than a donation followed by hurtfulness. For Allah is Self-Sufficient, Forbearing.
O you who have attained faith, do not nullify your donations with reminders and hurtfulness, like one who spends his wealth for show in front of people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock with dust upon it, then a heavy rain struck it and left it bare. They  have no power to retain anything of what they have earned. For Allah does not guide the denying people.
And the parable of those who spend their wealths seeking Allah’s pleasure and the affirmation of their (inner)  selves is that of a garden on a hilltop struck by heavy rain, so it brought forth its crops twofold. And even if no heavy rain strikes it, then light rain (is sufficient)  . For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.
Would anyone of you like to have a garden of palms and grapevines under which rivers flow, wherein he has of all kinds of products, but he is afflicted with old age and he has weak offspring—then it was struck with a fiery tornado and was thus burnt? Thus Allah makes the signs evident for you  pl   , that you may reflect.
O you who have attained faith, spend of the good things you have earned and from what We have brought out for you from the earth, and do not pick the nasty of it to give away, whereas you yourselves would not take it unless your eyes were closed to it. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.
Satan promises you  pl   poverty and commands you to obscenity, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself, and grace. For Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
He brings wisdom to whomever He wills, and whoever  is brought     wisdom , then he has most surely beenbrought much good. But none constantly remembers except those of understanding.
Thus whatever expenditure you  pl   have spent or vow you vow, then indeed Allah knows it. And the unjust have no supporters.
If you  pl   disclose donations, then that is excellent. But if you  pl   hide them and bring them to the needy, then that is better for  you. And He will remit    your evil deeds for you. For Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
Their guidance is not your  sg   responsibility, but Allah guides whomever He wills. And whatever good you  pl   spend is to your own benefit. And whatever good you spend shall be to seek Allah’s Countenance. And whatever good you  pl   spend will be repaid to you in full, for you will not be done injustice.
 (Donations are)  for the poor—those who are detained (for striving)  in the way of Allah, unable to travel in the land (for livelihood)  . Anyone ignorant (of their condition)  would think them rich due to their self-restraint. You  sg   recognize them by their mark (of poverty)  —they do not ask from people insistently. And whatever good you  pl   spend—Allah is indeed All-Knowing of it.
Those who spend their wealths by night and day, secretly and publicly—their reward is with their Lord, and  no fear     shall be upon them nor shall they grieve.
Those who devour usury cannot stand  except as does one who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they said, “Trade and usury are certainly the same.” But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden usury. Thus, to whomsoever an admonition came from his Lord, so he refrained (from usury)  —then his past earnings belong to him and his matter rests with Allah. Yet whoever reverts—then those  are the fellows of the Fire; therein they abide.
Allah eliminates usury and He makes donations grow, for Allah does not love every sinning relentless denier.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds and have established the prayer and have brought  the purifying charity  —their reward is with their Lord, and  no fear   a    shall be upon them nor shall they grieve.
O you who have attained faith, be mindful of Allah and leave aside what has remained of usury, if you are believers.
But if you  pl   do not, then  be informed    of a war from Allah and His Messenger. Yet if you repent, then your capitals belong to you— (thus)  you do no injustice, and you are not done injustice.
But if he  has hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to donate  it is better for you  pl   , if you only knew.
And be mindful of a day  when  you   pl    are returned    to Allah, then the earnings of every single self are rendered in full to it, for they  are not done injustice.
O you who have attained faith, when you transact a debt for a stated term, write it down. And have a scribe write between you, in fairness. And let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write, and let the one upon whom is the duty of payment  g   dictate. And let him be mindful of Allah, his Lord, and defraud nothing of it. But if the one upon whom is the duty of payment is mentally deficient or weak or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with fairness. And call to witness two of your men, but if the two are not men, then one man and two women from those whom you  pl   approve of as witnesses— so that if one of them should err     , the other can remind her . And witnesses must not abstain when called upon. And be not averse to writing it down, whether small or large (in value)  , including its term. That is more just with Allah  and more upright for testimony and more likely to make you not doubt—except in the case of an immediate bargain you conduct among yourselves—for (then)  you commit no sin if you do not write it down. But (otherwise)  let there be witnesses whenever you trade with one another. And let no harm befall any scribe or witness, for if you ever do so, it shall be ungodliness on your part. And be mindful of Allah, and Allah teaches you, for Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
But if you  pl   are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a security shouldbe handed over. But if you trust one another, let the one who was trusted fulfill his trust, and let him be mindful of Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it—indeed, he has a sinful heart. And Allah is All-Knowing of what you do.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Hence, whether you  pl   disclose what is within your selves or hide it, Allah calls you to account for it; He then forgives whomever He wills and He punishes whomever He wills, for Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
The Messenger has attained faith in what was sent down to him from his Lord, as have the believers. They have all attained faith in Allah and His angels and His  scriptures    and His messengers: “ We make    no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they said, “We have heard and obeyed. (Grant us)  Your forgiveness, our Lord, for to You is the destiny.”
Allah does not task any self beyond its capacity. To its credit is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed. “Our Lord, do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, and do not burden us with a heavy load as You burdened those before us. Our Lord, and do not overburden us with what we have no capability for, and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy upon us. You are our Patron, so support us against the denying people.”
