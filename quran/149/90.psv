No! I swear by this city,
and you sg are free of restriction in this city.
By the begetter and what he has begotten—
We have certainly created man in distress.
Does he think that no one will be able to restrain him?
He says, “I have consumed stacks of wealth.”
Does he think that no one has seen him?
Have We not made for him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips,
and showed him the two courses ?
But he did not brave the difficult route.
And what can make you realize what the difficult route is?
 (It is) the freeing of a neck (from the yokes of slavery) , 
 or the feeding—on a day of starvation—of 
an orphaned relative
or a destitute person in the dust ,
then becoming of those who attained faith and enjoined upon one another patience and enjoined upon one another compassion—
those are the fellows of the rightness.
But those who denied Our revelations—those are the fellows of the ill-omened;
over them is a fire with no exit.
