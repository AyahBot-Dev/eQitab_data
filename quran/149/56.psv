When the inevitable event befalls,
no disbelief will there be about its befalling,
bringing low, raising high.
When the earth is shaken violently,
and mountains are crushed and crumbled
and become scattered dust,
and you become three classes:
the fellows of the rightness; what of the fellows of the rightness!
And the fellows of the ill-omened; what of the fellows of the ill-omened!
And the pioneers, the pioneers:
those are the ones brought near (to God)  
in the Gardens of Bliss—
a throng from the ancients
and a small band from the latecomers,
on luxurious couches,
leaning on them, facing one another.
Serving them will be immortal youths
with glasses, and pitchers, and a cup from a flowing spring,
causing them  neither headache nor intoxication    ,
and fruit of their choice,
and meat of any bird they may  desire. 
 And  (in it are)   spouses    with lovely wide eyes,
like well-preserved pearls,
as a repayment on account of what they used to do.
Therein they will hear no idle talk and no recrimination
except for the saying: “Peace, peace.”
And the fellows of the right—what of the fellows of the right?
Amid thornless lote-trees
and clustered banana-trees
and extended shade
and outpouring water
and abundant fruit,
neither withheld nor forbidden.
And high-class spouses;
We have created them perfectly
and made them virgins,
tender, of matching age,
for the fellows of the right—
a throng from the ancients
and a throng from the latecomers.
And the fellows of the left—what of the fellows of the left?
Amid searing wind and scalding water
and a shadow of thick smoke,
neither cool nor refreshing  .
They had lived before that indulging in affluence,
and they used to insist on great violation,
and they used to say, “Can it be that when we have died and become dust and bones— can it be that    we will really be resurrected?
 And     our ancient forefathers, too ?”
Say  sg   , “Indeed, the ancients and the latecomers
will be gathered for the appointment of a well-known day!
Then indeed all of you, O misguided disbelievers,
will certainly be eating from the trees of Zaqqum  
and filling your bellies with it
and will be drinking on top of it scalding water,
thus drinking as a thirst-mad camel drinks.”
That is their hospitality on the Day of Recompense.
We have created you  pl   ; if only you would believe!
Have you  pl   seen what you ejaculate?
Is it you  pl   who create it or are We the Creators?
We have decreed death among you  pl   , and We will not be outstripped
in replacing you with your likes and transforming you into what you do not know.
And you  pl   have certainly known the first formation; if only you would  remind     yourselves !
Have you  pl   seen what you cultivate?
Is it you who plant it or are We the Planters?
If We will, We can turn it into rubble, then you  pl   will lament,
“ Indeed, we     are in debt ; 
 rather , we are dispossessed!”
Have you  pl   seen the water you drink?
Is it you who sent it down from the rainclouds or are We the Senders?
If We will, We can make it salty. Will you  pl   not be thankful?
Have you seen the fire you kindle?
Is it you who produced the tree for it, or are We the Producers?
We have made it a reminding and a comfort for the travelers.
So highly exalt the Name of your  sg   Lord, the Great.
I swear by the  locations    of the stars—
and it is certainly a great oath if only you  pl   were to know.
It is indeed a Noble Recital  
in a well-protected Scripture.
None touches it except the cleansed,
a bestowal from on high by the Lord of all realms.
Is it this discourse that you  pl   take so lightly?
And you render due thanks for being provided with it by disbelieving in it?
So when it  has reached the throat,
and you are at that moment looking on,
and We are nearer to him than you are, but you do not see—
why, if you are not to be held to account,
do you not bring it  a   back if you are truthful?
Yet, if he is one of those brought near (to God)  ,
then  serenity     and fragrant plants and a Garden of Bliss.
And if he is one of the fellows of the right,
then, “Peace for you  sg   ,” from the fellows of the right.
But if he is one of the misguided disbelievers,
then the welcome will be scalding water
and roasting in purgatory.
Indeed, this is surely the truth of certitude.
So highly exalt the Name of your  sg   Lord, the Great.
