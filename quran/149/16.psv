Allah’s command has come, so do  pl   not rush it. Highly Exalted is He, and Most High above what  they     associate  (with Him)  .
 He  bestows     the angels from on high with the Spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants: “Give  pl   warning that there is no god but Me, so be mindful of Me.”
He created the heavens and the earth with truth. Most High is He above what they associate (with Him)  .
He created man from a sperm-drop, yet he becomes an evident adversary!
And livestock—He created them for you  pl   . In them are warmth and benefits for you, and of them you eat.
And there is beauty in them for you when you drive them home and when you drive them to pasture.
And they carry your heavy burdens to a land you could not have reached without great hardship to yourselves; indeed, your Lord is truly Compassionate, Bestowing of mercy.
And horses and mules and donkeys—that you may ride them, and as an adornment; and He creates what you do not know.
And it is upon Allah to point out the way, but some of them  are crooked. And had He willed, He would surely have guided you all.
It is He Who sent down to you from the sky water from which is a drink for you and from which are trees where you pasture.
With it  He  germinates    for you vegetation and olives and date-palms and grapevines and of all products. Indeed, in that is a sign for people who reflect.
And He has subjected to you the night and the day  and the sun     and the moon. And the stars are subjected by His command. Indeed, in that are signs for people who reason.
And (He has subjected)  whatever He has scattered for you in the earth of varying colors. Indeed, in that is a sign for people who constantly remember.
And He is the One Who subjected the sea, that you may eat from it tender meat and extract from it ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships plowing through it, and (all this)  so that you may seek of His bounties, and that you may give thanks.
And He cast firm mountains into the earth lest it sway with you, and rivers and ways, that you may be guided.
And landmarks  , and by the star they are guided.
Is One Who creates like one who does not create? Will you  never remind yourselves    ?
And if you  pl   were to count the blessings of Allah, you would not be able to enumerate them. Indeed, Allah is certainly Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And Allah knows whatever you keep secret and whatever you make public.
Yet those  they     call upon apart from Allah create nothing, while they (themselves)  are created.
 (They are, in fact)  dead, not alive, and they are unaware of when they will be resurrected.
Your  pl   God is one God. Therefore, those who do not believe in the Hereafter—their hearts are in denial and they act arrogantly.
Without doubt, Allah knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public; indeed, He does not like those who act arrogantly.
And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of the ancients.”
Let them carry their burdens, complete, on the Day of Resurrection, and some of the burdens of those they lead astray without knowledge. Undoubtedly, evil is what they bear.
Those before them did scheme, but Allah struck at the very foundations of their building, so the roof collapsed upon them from above them, and the punishment came upon them from where they were unaware.
Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He disgraces them and says, “Where are My associates for whose sake you used to  oppose     (the believers)  ? Those who were given knowledge said  , “Today disgrace and misery are indeed upon the deniers
whom the angels take at death while they are unjust to themselves.” Then they offered submission  : “We were doing no evil.” Yes! Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what you  pl   used to do.
Thus enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein.” And how miserable is the dwelling of the arrogant!
And it was said to those who were mindful (of God)  , “What did your Lord send down?” They said, “ (All that is)  good.” To those who have excelled in doing good in this Earlier (Life)  is goodness, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better. And indeed, how excellent is the home of the people who are mindful (of God)  :
Gardens of Perpetuity which they enter, beneath which rivers flow; therein they have whatever they desire. Thus Allah rewards the mindful  pl    (of Him)  :
those whom the angels take up (at death)  while they are goodly, saying, “Peace be upon you; enter the Garden (of Paradise)  on account of what you used to do.”
Are they but waiting for the angels to come to them, or for the command of your Lord to come? Those before them did likewise. And Allah did not do them any injustice, but to themselves they used to do injustice.
So the evils of what they had done afflicted them, and they became surrounded by what they used to ridicule.
And those who had associated (others with Allah)  said, “Had Allah willed, we would never have worshiped anything apart from Him—neither us, nor our forefathers, nor would we have prohibited anything without (permission from)  Him.” Those before them did likewise. So are the messengers responsible for anything but evident proclamation?
For very truly, in every community We sent a messenger: “Worship  pl   Allah and avoid false masters.” So some of them Allah has guided, and some of them have deserved misguidance. So journey  through the earth and look what the outcome was for the disbelievers.
 (Even)  if you  sg   are concerned about their guidance, (still)   Allah surely does not guide whomever He leads     astray , and they will have no helpers.
And they have sworn by Allah their most solemn oaths that Allah does not resurrect whoever dies. Yes indeed, it is a promise binding on Him, but the majority of mankind does not know.
 (This is)  to clarify for them what they differ over, and so that those who have denied know that they were liars.
Indeed, Our only saying to anything, once We have wanted it, is to say to it,  “Be,” and so it is    .
And those who emigrated for Allah after they had been dealt with unjustly—We will surely settle them in a good place in the Earlier (Life)  , and the reward of the Hereafter is truly greater, if they only knew.
Those are the ones who endured patiently, and in their Lord they place  their trust.
And never did We send as messengers before you  sg   except men to whom  We reveal    . So ask  pl   the people of the Reminder if you do not know.
 (We sent them)  with evident proofs and books. And We sent down to you  sg   the Reminder, that you may clarify to mankind what was bestowed upon them from on high, and that they may reflect.
Do those who have schemed evils feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to cave in beneath them, or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they are unaware?
Or that He will not seize them (suddenly)  during their movement so that they cannot thwart (Him)  ?
Or that He will not seize them gradually? Yet indeed, your Lord is truly Compassionate, Bestowing of mercy.
Have  they     not seen all things that Allah has created—their shadows revolving from the right and the left, prostrating to Allah as they shrink away?
And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth of every treading creature, as well as the angels, and they do not act arrogantly—
fearing their Lord above them and doing whatever they are commanded.
And Allah has said: “Do  pl   not take two gods; He is but One God, so of Me  alone be in awe.”
And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and religion is His forever. Are you then mindful of anyone other than Allah?
And whatever blessing you  pl   have is from Allah, then when harm touches you, it is to Him that you cry for help.
Then when He lifts off harm from you, a group of you associate (others)  with their Lord,
so as to deny what We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, for you will come to know.
And they set up to what they do not know a share of what We have provided for them. By Allah, you  will surely be asked about what you  pl   used to fabricate.
And they set up to Allah daughters—Highly Exalted is He—and unto themselves whatever they desire.
But when one of them is given the glad tidings  of a female (infant)  , his countenance remains darkened as he suppresses his anguish.
He hides himself from people because of the evilness of the glad tidings he has been given. Should he keep it, in shame, or bury it (alive)  in the dust? Undoubtedly, evil is the way they judge!
For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is an evil example, while to Allah belongs the highest example. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
And if Allah were to hold mankind for their injustices, He would not leave upon it a single treading creature, but He defers them to a stated term. Then, when their term has arrived  , they cannot delay it by one hour nor can they advance it.
And they set up for Allah what they themselves hate, while their tongues describe the lie that theirs is the best (reward)  ; without doubt, for them is the Fire and (without doubt)   they will be driven to it quickly    .
 (I swear )  by Allah, We sent messengers to communities before you  sg   , but Satan adorned their deeds for them, so that he is their master today, and they will have a painful punishment.
And We have not sent down to you  sg   the Scripture but that you may clarify for them what they have differed over, and as a guidance and a mercy for people who believe.
And Allah has sent down, from the sky, water with which He revived the earth after it was lifeless; indeed, in this is a sign for people who hear.
And indeed, there is a lesson for you  pl   in livestock:  We     give you to drink of what is in their bellies—from between filth and blood—pure milk, palatable to the drinkers.
And from the products of date-palms and grapevines you make an intoxicating beverage and good food. Surely, in that is a sign for people who reason.
And your  sg   Lord revealed to the bee: “Take for yourself  sg   homes of the mountains, and of the trees and of whatever they trellis,
then eat of all products and go along the ways of your Lord, made smooth”. From their bellies comes out a drink of diverse colors, wherein is a cure for mankind. Surely, in that is a sign for people who reflect.
And Allah created you  pl   , then He takes you (at death)  . Yet among you is the one who is turned back to the most abject age, so that he no longer knows anything after having acquired knowledge; indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.
And Allah has favored some of you over others in provision, yet those who were favored do not give their provision to those whom they rightfully possess, to the extent of making them equal partners in it. Do  they     then repudiate the blessing of Allah?
And Allah has set up for you spouses from among yourselves, and has assigned for you from your spouses, children and grandchildren, and has provided you with good things. Yet is it in falsehood that they  believe, while it is the blessing of Allah that they deny?
And yet they worship apart from Allah what possesses no provisions for them in the heavens or the earth, nor are they capable (of doing anything)  .
So do  pl   not set forth any parables for Allah; indeed, Allah knows and you know not.
Allah set forth a parable: an owned bondman who has no power over anything, and (on the other hand)  someone to whom We  have given goodly provision from which he gives, secretly and openly. Can they be equal? All praise be to Allah; rather, most of them know not.
And Allah set forth a parable of two men: one of them a mute who has no power over anything, and he is wholly dependent upon his patron; wherever he directs him, he achieves nothing good. Can he be equal to one who commands to justice and is on a straight path?
And to Allah belongs the hidden realm of the heavens and the earth, and the matter of the Hour is only as the twinkling of the eye or even nearer; indeed, Allah is Powerful over everything.
And Allah brought you  pl   out of your mothers’ bellies not knowing anything, and He assigned for you hearing and sight (s)  and burning hearts, that you may give thanks.
Have  they     not seen the birds subjected in the midst of the sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely, in that are signs for people who believe.
And Allah has made for you, of your houses, (places of)  rest and has assigned for you out of the skins of livestock (portable)  homes which you find light on the day you travel and on the day you encamp and, from their wool and fur and hair, furnishings and an enjoyment for a while.
And Allah has made for you  pl    shades out of what He created, and has made for you shelters of the mountains, and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat and garments to protect you from your violence; thus He completes His blessings upon you, that you may submit.
So if they  turn away, then certainly your  sg   only duty is evident proclamation.
They recognize Allah’s blessing then they deny it, as most of them are the deniers.
And on the day when We raise up a witness from every community —then those who denied are not permitted, nor are they allowed to make amends.
And when those who did injustice see the punishment, (they will realize that)  never shall it be lightened for them, nor shall they be given respite.
And when the ones who associated (others with God)  see their associates  , they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associates whom we used to call upon apart from You.” So they cast  to them the statement, “Very truly, you are liars.”
And they cast forth to Allah, on that day, (their)  submissiveness, and whatever they used to fabricate strayed away from them.
Those who denied and barred from the way of Allah—We  added punishment to their punishment on account of the corruption they used to cause.
And on a day when We raise in every community a witness against them from among them, and We brought  c   you  sg   as a witness against these. For We have bestowed upon you the Scripture from on high, as an explanation of everything and guidance and mercy and glad tidings for the Muslims  .
Indeed, Allah commands to justice and excelling in doing good and bringing   (charity)  to the relative, and He forbids obscenity and what is deplorable and oppression. He admonishes you, that you may  remind yourselves    .
And fulfill  pl   Allah’s covenant when you make a covenant, and do not violate your oaths after ratifying them, for surely you have made Allah your guarantor; indeed, Allah knows what you do.
And do  pl   not be like she who unravels her yarn, breaking it into pieces after she has spun it strongly, by using your oaths as a means of deception among you because one community is more prosperous than another community. Indeed, Allah is testing you thereby, and He will most surely clarify to you on the Day of Resurrection whatever you used to differ over.
And had Allah willed, He would have made you one community, but He leads astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills, and you will most surely be asked about what you used to do.
And do not use your oaths as a means of deception among you, lest a foot slip after being firm and you taste misery for barring (others)  from the way of Allah, and for you there will be a great punishment.
And do  pl   not purchase, in exchange for Allah’s covenant, a small price; indeed, what is with Allah is better for you, if you only knew.
What you have runs out, but what is with Allah remains. And  We     will most surely repay those who were patient their reward in accordance with the best of what they used to do.
Whoever has acted righteously, whether male or female, while being a believer—We will most surely grant him a good life, and We will most surely repay them  their reward in accordance with the best of what they used to do.
So when you  sg   recite the Recital  seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast.
Indeed, he has no authority over those who have attained faith and in their Lord they place their trust.
Indeed, his authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate (others with God)  .
Yet whenever We substitute a sign in place of another sign—and Allah  knows better what He  bestows from on high    —they say, “Indeed, you are nothing but a fabricator.” Rather, most of them do not know.
Say, The Holy Spirit has bestowed it from on high from your  sg   Lord  , with the truth, in order to strengthen those who have attained faith, and as guidance and glad tidings for Muslims  .
And most surely, We know that they say, “Indeed, it is a human being who is teaching him.” But the tongue of the one they allude to is foreign, while this is an evident Arabic tongue.
Indeed, those who do not believe in Allah’s signs—Allah does not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment.
Indeed, it is those who do not believe in Allah’s signs who fabricate falsehood, and those are the liars.
Whoever has denied Allah after attaining faith—except for someone who was compelled  while his heart rests securely in faith, but (rather)  whoever (willingly)  opens a chest to denial—upon them is wrath from Allah, and for them is a great punishment.
That is because they have sought the love of the Earlier Life over the Hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the denying people.
Those are the ones whose hearts and hearing and sight (s)  Allah has sealed, and those arethe oblivious ones.
Without doubt, in the Hereafter they are the losers.
Then surely your  sg   Lord—for those who emigrated after being persecuted, then strove and patiently persevered—indeed, your Lord thereafter is surely Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
On the day when every single self comes arguing for itself, and every soul is paid in full (for)  what it has done, and they are not done any injustice.
And Allah set forth a parable: a town that was safe (and)  secure, its provision coming to it abundantly from everywhere. Yet it denied Allah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the garment of hunger and fear on account of what they used to do.
And very truly, a messenger from among them had come to them, but they disbelieved him, so the punishment seized them while they were unjust.
So eat  pl   of the lawful and good things Allah has provided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s blessing, if it is Him that you worship.
Indeed, He has only forbidden you  pl   carrion and blood and the flesh of swine and anything consecrated to other than Allah; but if anyone is compelled by necessity without being deliberate or transgressing, then Allah is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And do not say lies concerning that which your tongues describe: “This is lawful and this is unlawful,” in order to fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah; indeed, those who fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah do not succeed.
A brief enjoyment, then for them is a painful punishment.
And for the ones who Judaized We have prohibited what We related to you  sg   before, and in no way did We do them any injustice, but to themselves they used to do injustice.
But indeed your  sg   Lord, towards those who did evil in ignorance and then repented afterwards and reformed—indeed, your  sg   Lord thereafter is surely Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Indeed, Abraham was a nation, devout towards Allah, turning away from all that is false, for never was he of the polytheists.
 (He was)  thankful for His blessings. He elected him and guided him to a straight path.
And We  brought him goodness in the Earlier (Life)  , and in the Hereafter he is surely of the righteous.
Then We revealed to you  sg   : “Follow  sg   the creed of Abraham, who turned away from all that is false, for never was he of the polytheists.”
Indeed, the Sabbath was ordained upon those who differed over it. And most surely, your  sg   Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding whatever they used to differ over.
Call  sg   to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good admonition, and debate with them by that which is better. Indeed, it is your Lord Who knows better of those who stray from His way, and it is He Who knows better of those who are guided.
And if you  pl   punish, then punish with the like of that with which you were punished. But if you resort to patience, it is surely better for the patient ones.
So be patient  sg   , for your patience is solely from Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be distressed because of what they scheme.
Indeed, Allah is with those who are mindful (of Him)  and those who excel in doing good.
