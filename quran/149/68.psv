Nûn. By the pen and all that they inscribe.
Your sg Lord’s blessing does not make you a madman.
And most surely, for you sg is an unfailing reward.
And very truly, you sg are of great moral character.
Thus you sg shall see and they shall see
which of you is the demented.
Indeed, your sg Lord is He Who knows better who has strayed from His way, and it is He Who knows better of the rightly guided.
So do not obey the disbelievers;
they would like you to compromise, then they too would compromise.
And do not obey any despicable swearer,
backbiter, spreader of malicious gossip,
preventer of good, transgressor, sinful,
brutal; moreover, of spurious parentage!
 Just because he has money and sons,
when Our signs are read to him, he says, “Legends of the ancients!”
We will brand him on the snout.
Indeed, We have tested them as We tested the fellows of the garden, when they swore to harvest it in the morning
without any reservation.
Then a sweeping visitation from your sg Lord swept through it while they were asleep,
and in the morning it was as though harvested.
So they called to each other in the early morning:
“Go early to your pl field if you are going to harvest.”
So they set out, murmuring to one another,
“Not one destitute person is to enter it upon you pl today.”
And early they went, resolved in intent.
But when they saw it, they said, “Indeed, we are surely misguided;
rather, we are deprived.”
The most reasonable of them said, “Did I not tell you pl , ‘if only you would highly exalt (God) ?’”
They said, “Highly Exalted is our Lord; indeed, we were unjust.”
Then they turned to each other, blaming one another.
They said, “Woe to us; indeed, we have exceeded all limits.
Perhaps our Lord will give us a better substitute for it. Indeed, to our Lord we turn wishfully.”
Such is the punishment (of this world) ; but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.
Indeed, for the people who are mindful (of God) are Gardens of Bliss, with their Lord.
Shall We treat the Muslims like the criminals?
What is the matter with you pl ? How do you judge?
Or do you have a scripture in which you study,
wherein there is whatever you choose?
Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand?
Ask sg them which of them guarantees that.
Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates if they are truthful.
On the day when the shin is exposed and they are called to prostrate themselves, but they are unable to.
Their sight (s) (subdued) in reverence, humiliation overwhelms them, for they had been called to prostrate themselves when they were sound.
So leave sg Me to those who reject this discourse; We will draw them forth gradually (to punishment) from where they do not know.
And I will give them respite. Indeed, My plot is firm.
Or do you sg ask them for a reward, so they are burdened with debt?
Or do they have (knowledge of) the hidden realm and they are writing it down?
So wait patiently for the Decree of your sg Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Whale, who cried out in despair.
Were it not for his Lord’s favor that reached him, he would have been thrown into the wilderness, fully despised.
But his Lord chose him and made him one of the righteous.
Those who have denied almost stab you sg with their sight (s) when they hear the Reminder, and say, “He is indeed a madman!”
But it is nothing other than a Reminder to (all creatures of) all realms.
