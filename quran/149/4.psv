O mankind, be mindful of your Lord, Who created you from a single self and created from it its spouse, and from them both spread many men and women. Thus be mindful of Allah —in Whose name you ask one another—and of the wombs . Indeed, Allah has always been Watchful over you.
And bring orphans their wealths, and do not replace (their) good things with nasty ones, and do not devour their wealths by combining them with your pl wealths; indeed, it has always been a gravely serious sin.
And if you pl fear you cannot be just towards the orphans, then marry the women you like—two or three or four—but if you fear you will not be equitable, then (only) one or (consider) those whom you rightfully possess. That is more likely to make you avoid bias.
Moreover, bring women their dowries graciously. But if they willingly forgo some of it for you pl , then devour it with satisfaction, with ease.
But do not bring the foolish ones your pl money which Allah has assigned to you for support, yet provide for them from it and clothe them and say to them a fair word.
And test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. So if you pl recognize in them prudence, then hand over their wealths to them and do not devour it extravagantly or hastily before they grow up. For the rich (guardian) should modestly abstain (from charging any wage) , but whoever (of the guardians) is poor may charge in accordance with what is fair. Then when you hand over their wealths to them, call witnesses in. Yet sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner.
For men is a share of what parents and close relatives have left, and for women is a share of what parents and close relatives have left, be it little or much—an ordained share.
And if the distribution is attended by the near relatives and the orphans and the destitute pl , then give them something out of it and say to them a fair word.
And let those who, were they to leave behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them, fear (God’s punishment). So let them be mindful of Allah and let them speak for justice.
Indeed, those who devour the wealths of orphans illicitly devour only fire into their bellies; and they will roast in a blaze.
Allah enjoins you pl regarding your children: for the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. But if they are women above two, they get two-thirds of what he has left; and if she be one, then to her is the half. And for his parents—each gets one-sixth of what he has left if he has children. Yet if he has no children and his parents inherit (solely) from him, then his mother getsone-third. But if he has siblings, then his mother gets one-sixth, after (fulfilling) any bequest he may bequeath and (paying off) any debt. Your parents and your children—you do not know which are more beneficial to you. (This is) an ordinance from Allah. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing All-Wise.
And you pl get one-half of what your spouses have left if they have no children. Yet if they have children, then you get one-fourth of what they have left, after (fulfilling) any bequest they may bequeath and (paying off) any debt. And they get one-fourth of what you have left if you have no children. Yet if you have children, then they get one-eighth of what you have left, after (fulfilling) any bequest you may bequeath and (paying off) any debt. And if a man or a woman is to be inherited by a non-lineal heir while having a brother or sister , then each of them gets one-sixth. But if they are more than that, then they share one-third, after (fulfilling) any bequest that may be bequeathed and (paying off) any debt, without any harm (to anyone). (This is) an injunction from Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing, Clement.
These are the limits of Allah. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger— He enters him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein, and that is the great triumph.
But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits— He enters g him into a fire wherein he abides, and for him is a demeaning punishment.
And those of your pl women who commit obscenity—call four of you to witness against them; then if they testify, confine them to the houses until death takes them up or Allah makes a way for them.
And those two of you who commit it, then punish them both. Yet if they repent and reform, then disregard them both. Indeed, Allah has always been Granting and Accepting of repentance, Bestowing of mercy.
Indeed, (granting of) repentance is (incumbent) upon Allahfor those who do evil out of ignorance then repent soon after, for those—Allah accepts their repentance. And Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
But (granting of) repentance is not for those who (continue to) do evil until, when death arrives to one of them, he says, “Indeed, I have now repented,” nor for those who die as deniers. Those—We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
O you who have attained faith, it is not lawful for you to inherit women forcefully, and do not coerce them in order to go away with some of what you have brought them, unless they commit an evident obscenity. And let your pl relationship with them be in accordance with what is fair. And if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good.
And if you pl want to replace one spouse with another spouse and you have given one of them a fortune, then take nothing back of it. Would you take it back (by committing) perjury and evident sin?
And how can you take it back when you have been intimate with one another and they have taken from you a solid pledge?
And do not marry women whom your fathers had married, except what has already passed. Indeed, that has been an obscenity and loathsome and an evil way.
Prohibited for you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts and your brother’s daughters and your sister’s daughters and your (foster) mothers who nursed you and your sisters through nursing and your wives’ mothers and your stepdaughters who are in your guardianship—born of wives with whom you have consummated marriage, but if you have not consummated marriage with them, then no sin is committed by you—and the lawful consorts of your begotten sons and to combine two sisters (in marriage, simultaneously) , except what has already passed. Indeed, Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And (also prohibited are) women in wedlock, except those whom you pl rightfully possess . (This is) Allah’s decree, binding upon you. But anything beyond these limits has been made lawful for you , provided you seek them in wedlock, not in fornication, with (dowries from) your own wealths. So if you wish to enjoy them, then bring them their rewards— (as) an obligation. And no sin is committed by you if you agree to any change to the dowry after establishing the obligation. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
But if one of you lacks the means to marry free believing women, then of those whom you rightfully possess from among your believing maidens. And Allah knows better of your faith. You are of one another , so marry them with the permission of their families and bring them their rewards in accordance with what is fair, in wedlock, not in fornication nor as mistresses. Then when they are married, if they commit an obscenity , then their punishment is half that of free women. That is for those of you who want to avoid distress (by falling in sin). But to be patient is better for you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Allah wants to make things evident to you pl and to guide you by the rules (He set) for those before you and to grant you repentance and accept it from you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And Allah wants to grant you repentance and accept it from you, while those who follow desires want you to deviate (with) a great deviation.
Allah wants to lighten (your burden) for you, for man was created weak.
O you who have attained faith, do not devour each other’s wealths illicitly; rather (lawfully) , if it should be a bargain by your mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves; indeed, Allah has always been Bestowing of mercy upon you.
And whoever does that out of hostility and unjustly—We will roast him in a fire, and that has always been easy for Allah .
If you pl avoid the major deeds of what you have been forbidden, We remit your (lesser) evil deeds and make you enter in a noble way .
And do not covet whatever Allah has favored some of you with over others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his grace. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing of everything.
Thus to everyone We have assigned heirs for what parents and close relatives have left. And those with whom you pl have a bond of sworn fidelity—bring them their share. Indeed, Allah has always been Witness over everything.
Men should be constant caretakers of women with what Allah has favored one over the other and with what they spend (for support) from their wealths. So righteous women are devout,preservers of (virtue, even regarding) hidden matters, as Allah (commanded matters to be) preserved . But those women from whom you pl fear disloyalty—admonish them and abandon them in beds and strike them . But if they obey you, then do not seek any way against them. Indeed, Allah has always been All-High, Supreme.
And if you pl fear discord between them dl , then send a judge from his family and a judge from her family; if they dl want reconciliation, Allah will bring about harmony between them. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Aware.
And worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him, and be good to both parents and to the relative and the orphans and the destitute pl , and the neighbor who is a relative and the neighbor who is a stranger, and the companion at your side and the traveler in need and to those whom you rightfully possess. Indeed, Allah does not love whoever has been a self-admiring boaster:
those who are miserly and command mankind to miserliness and conceal what Allah has brought them of His grace—and We have prepared for the deniers a demeaning punishment,
and those who spend their wealths for show in front of people and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. And whoever has Satan as a comrade, then how evil is such a comrade!
And what harm would it have done them, had they believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent out of what Allah had provided them? And Allah has always been All-Knowing about them.
Indeed, Allah does not do an atom’s weight of injustice. And if it is a good deed , He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.
So how will it be when We bring forth a witness from every community and We bring you sg forth as a witness over all these?
On that day, those who denied and disobeyed the Messenger wish that the earth would be leveled with them, for they conceal nothing from Allah.
O you who have attained faith, do not approach prayer while you are drunk so that you may know what you say, nor while you are in a state of major impurity —unless you are traveling—until you have bathed. And if you are sick or traveling or one of you returns from relieving oneself or you have touched women (in intercourse) and cannot find water, then find clean soil and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Indeed, Allah has always been Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.
Have you sg not seen those who were given a share of the Scripture? They purchase utter misguidance and want you pl to stray from the way.
Yet Allah knows better of your pl enemies, and sufficient is Allah as an Ally, and sufficient is Allah as a Supporter.
Some of those who have Judaized distort words from their context and say, “We have heard and disobeyed,” and “Listen; may you sg not hear,” and “Raʻina ”, twisting it with their tongues and thereby slandering the religion. But had they said, “We have heard and obeyed,” and “Listen,” and “Give us your sg attention,” it would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their denial, so they do not believe except for a few.
O you who have been brought the Scripture, believe in what We have bestowed from on high, confirming what you have, before We obliterate faces and turn them around upon their backs, or curse them as We cursed the fellows of the Sabbath . And the command of Allah is bound to be performed.
Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating (any partners) with Him, yet He forgives anything less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates anything with Allah has very truly fabricated a great sin.
Have you sg not seen those who claim purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with unjustly by as much as the thread upon a date-stone.
See sg how they fabricate lies against Allah, and that alone suffices as an evident sin.
Have you sg not seen those who were given a share of the Scripture? They believe in superstition and false masters, and say of those who have denied, “These are better guided on the way than the ones who have believed.”
Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; and whomever Allah curses, you will find no supporter for him.
Or do they own a share of the dominion? Then they do not bring to mankind by as much as a groove in a date-stone.
Or do they envy mankind for whatever Allah has brought them of His grace? For surely, We brought Abraham’s folk the Scripture and wisdom, and We gave them a great dominion.
Then, of them there were those who attained faith in him, and of them were those who barred from him. And sufficient is Hell as a blaze.
Indeed, those who have denied Our signs—We will roast them in a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins so that they may (continue to) taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah has always been Almighty, All-Wise.
But those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—We will enter them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; for them in it are cleansed spouses, and We will admit them into an ever-shading shade.
Indeed, Allah commands you pl to return trusts back to their owners, and that when you judge between mankind, you judge with justice; indeed, Allah admonishes you with what is excellent. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who have attained faith, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in command among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and fairer in interpretation.
Have you sg not seen those who claim that they have believed in what was sent down to you and what was sent down before you, yet they want the judgment of false masters in spite of being commanded to deny it? For Satan wants to make them stray into extreme misguidance.
And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger,” you see the hypocrites barring (themselves and others) from you sg completely.
So how will it be when a calamity befalls them because of what their hands have put forth, then they come to you sg swearing by Allah: “We only wanted excelling in doing good and bringing about harmony”?
Those are the ones whom Allah knowswhatever is in their hearts, so disregard them, yet admonish them and say to them words far-reaching to their (inner) selves.
And never did We send any messenger but to be obeyed by Allah’s leave . And had they—after being unjust to themselves—come to you sg and sought Allah’s forgiveness, and had the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would have found Allah Granting and Accepting of repentance, Bestowing of mercy.
But no, by your sg Lord, they will never attain faith until they make you judge in their disputes, then find within themselves no discomfort from whatever you have decreed and submit completely.
And had We decreed for them: “Kill yourselves,” or “Depart your homes,” they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But had they done what they were admonished, it would have been better for them and a firmer confirmation.
And We would then have brought them from Us a great reward,
and We would have guided them to a straight path.
And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger—then those are with the ones whom Allah has blessed of the prophets and the unwavering believers and the witnesses and the righteous, and excellent are those as company!
That is the grace from Allah, and sufficient is Allah as All-Knowing.
O you who have attained faith, take your precautions, then mobilize in groups or mobilize all together.
And indeed, there is among you one who would certainly tarry behind; then, if a calamity befalls you, he would say, “Allah has truly favored me as I was not a witness with them.”
But if some grace from Allah befalls you pl , he would say—as if no love existed between you and him—“If only I had been with them, I could have triumphed a great triumph.”
Let those who sell the Earlier Life in exchange for the Hereafter combat in the cause of Allah. For whoever combats in the way of Allah, then is killed or overcomes, We will bring him a great reward.
And what is the matter with you pl that you do not combat in the way of Allah and for the ones deemed weak and oppressed among men and women and children—those who say, “Our Lord, get us out from this town whose people are unjust, and appoint for us from You a guardian, and appoint for us from You a supporter!”?
Those who have attained faith combat in the way of Allah, while those who have denied combat in the way of false masters. So combat pl the allies of Satan; indeed, the plotting of Satan has always been weak.
Have you sg not seen those who were told, “Restrain your hands and establish the prayer and bring the purifying charity ”? But when combat was prescribed for them, a group of them feared mankind as only Allah ought to be feared, or even more. And they said, “Our Lord, why did You prescribe combat for us? If only You would delay it for us for a short while.” Say sg , “The enjoyment of the Earlier (Life) is little, while the Hereafter is better for whoever is mindful (of God) , and you will not be dealt with unjustly by as much as the thread upon a date-stone.”
Wherever you pl may be, death will overtake you, even if you were in lofty towers. And if any good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah.” But when any evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say sg , “All is from Allah.” So what is wrong with these people, that they hardly comprehend any discourse?
Whatever good has befallen you sg is from Allah, and whatever evil has befallen you is from your own (inner) self. And We sent you to mankind as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger has surely obeyed Allah, but whoever turns away—then We have not sent you to be a constant preserver over them.
And they say “(We pledge) obedience,” but when they leave your presence, a faction of them conspire something contrary to what you say, yet Allah records what they conspire. So disregard them and place your trust in Allah, for sufficient is Allah as a Trustee.
Do they not ponder the Recital ? For had it been from any other than Allah, they would have found in it much discrepancy.
And when a matter of security or fear comes to them, they publicize it. But had they referred it to the Messenger and to those in command among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have learned it. And were it not for Allah’s blessingand mercy upon you pl , you would have followed Satan, except for a few.
So combat sg in the way of Allah; you are not responsible except for yourself. And urge the believers. Hopefully Allah will restrain the force of those who have denied, and Allah is of more intense force and more tormenting.
Whoever intercedes for a good cause shall have a portion of it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shall have a share of it. And Allah has always been a Sustainer for everything.
And if you pl are greeted with a greeting, then respond with a better one or (at least) return it. Indeed, Allah has always been a Reckoner of everything.
Allah—there is no god except He. He will surely gather you pl to the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who is truer in discourse than Allah?
So what is the matter with you, that you are divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites, when Allah Himself has caused them to regress on account of what they have earned? Do you want to guide those whom Allah has misguided? For whomever Allah misguides, you sg will never find for him any way .
They would love to see you pl deny just as they themselves have denied, so that you would become equal. So take no allies from them until they emigrate in the way of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you may find them, and do not take from among them any ally or supporter.
Except those who are related to a people between you pl and whom is a pledge, or those who come to you with their hearts constrained from combating you or combating their own people. And had Allah willed, He would have given them authority over you and they would surely have combated you. So if they withdraw from you pl and combat not against you and offer you peace, then Allah has opened no way for you against them.
You pl will find others who want to be secure from you and secure from their own people—whenever they are turned back to temptation, they are made to regress in it. So if they do not withdraw from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. And those ones—We have given you, regarding them, an evident authorization.
But never should a believer kill another believer, unless accidentally. Yet anyone who accidentally kills a believer, then the (atonement is the) emancipation of a believing slave and a compensation submitted to his family, unless they donate (it) . But if he was from a people who are an enemy to you pl , yet he is a believer, then the emancipation of a believing slave. And if he was from a people between you and whom there is a pledge, then a compensation submitted to his family and the emancipation of a believing slave. And (for) anyone who lacks the means—then the fasting of two consecutive months as a repentance to Allah. And Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
But whoever kills a believer intentionally—then his repayment is Hell, abiding therein, and upon him is Allah’s wrath and He has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.
O you who have attained faith, when you travel (to strive) in the way of Allah, then you shall investigate . And do not say to anyone who offers you peace , “You are not a believer ,” aspiring for the goods of the Earlier Life, for with Allah is a multitude of gains . You yourselves were like this before, then Allah bestowed favor upon you, so ascertain (the truth). Indeed, Allah has always been All-Aware of what you do.
Those of the believers who, though not disabled, stay behind, are not equal to those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealths and their lives . Allah has favored those who strive with their wealths and their lives above those who stay behind with a degree (of rank) . But Allah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah has favored those who strive over those who stay behind with a great reward:
 (high) degrees (of rank) from Him, and forgiveness and mercy, for Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Indeed, (regarding) those whom the angels took up at death while they were unjust to themselves, they said, “What was the matter with you?” They said, “We were deemed weak and oppressed in the land.” They said, “Was Allah’s earth not vast enough for you to emigrate therein?” So those—their shelter is Hell, and what an evil destiny!
Except for those deemed weak and oppressed among men and women and children who cannot devise any plan and are not guided to any way,
for those—hopefully Allah will pardon them, for Allah has always been Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.
Thus anyone who emigrates in the way of Allah will find on earth many places of refuge and abundance. And anyone who sets out from his house, emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and is then overtaken by death, then his reward is incumbent on Allah. And Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And when you pl travel in the land, you commit no sin by shortening the prayers if you fear that the deniers may harm you; indeed, the deniers have always been an evident enemy to you.
And when you sg are among them and you call them to prayer, let a faction of them stand with you and let them hold their weapons. Then when they have done their prostrations, let them be behind you pl and let another faction that has not prayed yet come forward and pray with you sg , and let them take their precautions and their weapons. Those who denied would love that you pl become oblivious to your weapons and your belongings so they can assault you in a single assault. And no sin is committed by you—if you are hurt by rain or are sick—by putting down your weapons, but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the deniers a demeaning punishment.
So when you pl have concluded the prayer, then remember Allah, standing and sitting and on your sides. Thereafter, when you feel secure, establish the prayer. Indeed, the prayer has been prescribed upon believers at specific times.
And do not waver pl in the pursuit of the people ; if you suffer pain, they suffer pain as you suffer pain, but you expect from Allah what they do not expect. And Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
Indeed, We have sent down to you sg the Scripture with the truth, to judge between mankind in accordance with what Allah has shown you. And do not be an advocate for the treacherous.
And ask sg Allah for forgiveness; indeed, Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And do sg not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves. Indeed, Allah does not love whoever has been consistently treacherous, sinful.
They seek to hide from mankind, but they do not seek to hide from Allah , and He is with them when they conspire , (using) what He does not accept of speech. And Allah has always been All-Encompassing of what they do.
There you pl are, having argued on their behalf in the Earlier Life, but who will argue with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be their trustee?
Yet whoever commits evil or does injustice to himself then asks Allah for forgiveness will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And whoever earns a sin—he only earns it to his own detriment, for Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
And whoever earns an offense or a sin then blames it on an innocent person, then he has surely burdened himself with perjury and evident sin.
And were it not for Allah’s grace towards you sg , and His mercy, a faction of them would have sought to lead you astray. But they lead no one astray except themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. And Allah has sent down to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. And Allah’s grace towards you has always been great.
There is no good in much of their private conversations, except for one who commands to (even a single) donation or to what is fair or to reconciliation between people. And whoever does that, seeking Allah’s pleasure, then We will bring him a great reward.
But whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become evident to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn him towards what he has turned to and roast him in Hell—and what an evil destiny!
Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating (any partners) with Him, yet He forgives anything less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates (others) with Allah, then he has surely strayed into extreme misguidance.
They call upon, instead of Him, only females. (In fact) they call upon nothing but a defiant Satan—
Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will most surely take to myself a due share of Your servants.”
“And I will most surely lead them astray and fill them with fancies, and I will most surely command them so they will most surely slit the ears of cattle, and most surely I will command them so they will most surely alter the creation of Allah.” Thus, whoever takes Satan for a guardian apart from Allah has truly lost an evident loss.
He promises them and fills them with fancies, but Satan promises them nothing but a deception.
Those—their shelter is Hell, and they find no escape from it.
But those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—We will enter them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever; the promise of Allah is true, and whose word is more truthful than Allah?
It is not according to your fancies, nor to the fancies of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does evil will be repaid for it and will not find for himself apart from Allah any ally or supporter.
But whoever does of righteous deeds, whether male or female, and is a believer—those will enter the Garden (of Paradise) and will not be dealt with unjustly by as much as the dint on a date-stone.
And who could be better in religion than one who submitted his countenance to Allah, while excelling in doing good, and followed the creed of Abraham who turned away from all that is false. For Allah took Abraham for a close friend.
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah has always been All-Encompassing of everything.
They ask you for a ruling about women. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling about them, and (so does) what is read to you in the Scripture about orphan women to whom you do not bring what is prescribed for them, yet you wish to marry them, and (about) those deemed weak and oppressed from among children and that you should treat orphans justly. And whatever good you do—indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing of it.”
And if a woman fears disloyalty or disregard from her husband, then no sin is committed by them if they reform what is between themselves , for reconciliation is better. Yet stinginess has been brought to the (inner) selves. But if you pl excel in doing good and become mindful (of God) —indeed, Allah has always been All-Aware of what you do.
Furthermore, you pl will not be able to be equitable between the women no matter how keen you are, so do not be so biased as to leave her suspended. Rather, if you reform and become mindful (of God) —indeed, Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Yet if they both separate, Allah will enrich each from His vast means , for Allah has always been All-Embracing, All-Wise.
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And very truly We have admonished those who were brought the Scripture before you, as well as yourselves, “Be mindful of Allah . But if you deny—then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah has always been Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And sufficient is Allah as a Trustee.
If He wills, He can do away with you, O mankind, and bring others. For Allah has always been All-Able to do that.
Whoever wants the recompense of the Earlier (Life) —with Allah is the recompense of the Earlier (Life) and the Hereafter. And Allah has always been All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
O you who have attained faith, always stand for justice, as witnesses for the sake of Allah, even if against yourselves or the parents or the close relatives. Whether a person is rich or poor, Allah is worthier as a patron of both. So do not follow prejudice so as to do justice. But if you twist (your testimony) or disregard (giving it) —then indeed Allah has always been All-Aware of what you do.
O you who have attained faith, have faith in Allah and His Messenger and the Scripture which He bestowed upon His Messenger from on high and the Scripture He sent down before. And whoever denies Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers and the Last Day, then he has surely strayed into extreme misguidance.
Indeed, those who attained faith then denied, then attained faith then denied, then increased in denial—never is Allah to forgive them nor guide them to a way.
Give sg glad tidings to the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment—
those who take the deniers as allies apart from the believers. Do they seek might from them? For indeed, all might belongs to Allah.
For He has surely bestowed upon you pl from on high, in the Scripture, that when you hear Allah’s signs being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit with them until they engage in some other discourse; you would then be like them. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and the deniers in Hell, all together—
those who lie in wait for you pl , so if there is a conquest for you from Allah, they say, “Were we not with you?” While if the deniers have any measure (of success) , they say, “Did we not have privilege over you and defend you from the believers?” Then Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will never grant any way for the deniers against the believers.
Indeed, the hypocrites try to deceive Allah, while He deceives them. And when they rise for prayer they rise lazily, for show in front of mankind. And they do not remember Allah except a little,
wavering in between, neither with these nor with these. For whomever Allah leads astray—then you sg will not find any way for him.
O you who have attained faith, do not take the deniers as allies apart from the believers. Do you want to give Allah evident proof against you?
Indeed, the hypocrites are in the lowest level of the Fire, and you sg will not find any supporter for them—
except those who repented and reformed and held fast to Allah and dedicated their religion faithfully to Allah, for those are with the believers, and Allah will bring the believers a great reward.
What would Allah do with your pl punishment if you have given thanks and have attained faith, when Allah has always been Thankful, All-Knowing?
Allah does not like the public uttering of offensive words unless someone has been dealt with unjustly, for Allah has always been All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Whether you pl disclose something good or hide it or pardon something bad—Allah has always been Pardoning, All-Able.
Indeed, those who deny Allah and His messengers, and want to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers, and say, “We believe in some and deny some,” and want to take a way in between—
it is those who are truly the deniers, and We have prepared for the deniers a demeaning punishment.
But those who have attained faith in Allah and His messengers and have made no distinction between any of them—those, He will bring them their rewards. For Allah has always been Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
The People of the Scripture ask you sg to bestow upon them a scripture from heaven. For truly, they had asked Moses for something even greater than that, for they said, “Show us Allah openly.” So the thunderbolt took them on account of their injustice. Then they took the calf for worship after the evident proofs had come to them, yet We pardoned that, and We brought Moses evident authority.
And We raised Mount Tûr above them in accordance with their pledge, and We said to them, “Enter the gate prostrating,” and We said to them, “Do not transgress the Sabbath”, and We took from them a solid pledge.
But for their violation of their pledge, and their denial of Allah’s signs, and their unjustified killing of the prophets, and their saying, “Our hearts are wrapped”… Rather, Allah put a seal upon them on account of their denial, so they do not believe, except for a few.
And on account of their denial and their saying against Mary a great slander,
and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah”… In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.
Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself, for Allah has always been Almighty, All-Wise.
Surely, there is none from the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.
So on account of the injustice on the part of the ones who have Judaized We forbade them good things that used to be lawful for them, and on account of barring a lot from the way of Allah,
and their taking of usury—though they were forbidden it—and their devouring of people’s wealths illicitly. And We have prepared for the deniers among them a painful punishment.
But those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what was sent down to you sg and in what was sent down before you. And those who establish the prayers, and those who bring the purifying charity , and the believers in Allah and the Last Day—those, We will bring them a great reward.
Indeed, We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Grandsons and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and We brought David a Book.
And messengers (the stories of) whom We have already narrated to you sg and messengers (the stories of) whom We have not narrated to you. And Allah spoke to Moses with (direct) speech.
Messengers—bearing glad tidings and forewarning, that mankind may have no excuse before Allah after the (coming of the) messengers, for Allah has always been Almighty, All-Wise.
But Allah bears witness to what He sent down to you; He sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness, though Allah suffices as a witness.
Surely those who have denied and barred from the way of Allah have truly strayed into extreme misguidance.
Surely those who have denied and have done injustice—indeed, Allah is not to forgive them, nor is He to guide them to any road
except the road to Hell, abiding therein forever. And that has always been easy for Allah.
O mankind, the Messenger has truly come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe—that is better for you. But if you deny, then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, for Allah has always been All-Knowing, All-Wise.
O People of the Scripture, do not exaggerate in your religion, and do not say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is indeed nothing but Allah’s Messenger and His Word that He cast to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Refrain— (that is) better for you. Indeed, Allah is only one God; Highly Exalted is He—that He should have a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah suffices as a Trustee.
Never shall the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor shall the angels who are brought near. And whoever disdains His worship and acts arrogantly—He will herd them to Himself, all together.
But as for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds, He will render them their rewards in full and increase His grace for them. But as for those who were disdainful and acted arrogantly, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will find for themselves, apart from Allah, neither ally nor supporter.
O mankind, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you an evident light.
So as for those who have attained faith in Allah and have held fast to Him, He will enter them into mercy from Him, and grace, and will guide them to Himself on a straight path.
They ask you sg for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning the person who has non-lineal heirs.” If a man dies and leaves no children and he has a sister, then for her is one-half of what he has left. And he inherits from her if she has no children. But if they are two (sisters) , then for them are two-thirds of what he has left. Yet if the siblings are men and women, then for the male is the share of two females.” Allah makes things evident for you, lest you pl go astray. For Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
