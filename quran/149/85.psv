By the sky full of constellations.
By the Promised Day.
By the witness and the witnessed—
may they perish: the fellows of the Trench  
 (of)  the fire fed with fuel!
Recall when they sat around it,
witnessing what they were doing to the believers.
And they resented them only for believing in Allah the Almighty, the Praiseworthy,
to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Yet Allah is Witness over everything.
Indeed, those who have persecuted the believing men and the believing women, then have not repented—for them is the punishment of Hell, and for them is the punishment of burning.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; that is the supreme triumph.
Indeed, the onslaught of your  sg   Lord is surely severe.
Indeed, it is He who originates and reproduces,
and He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Loving,
Possessor of the  Throne, the Glorious    ,
Doer of whatever He wants.
Has there come to you  sg   the story of the troops—
 (that of)  Pharaoh and Thamûd  ?
Rather, the deniers are in (a state of)  disbelief,
while beyond them Allah is All-Encompassing.
Rather, it is a Glorious Recital  b   ,
in a  preserved     Tablet .
