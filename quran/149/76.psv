Has there come upon man a period of time when he was nothing to be mentioned?
Indeed, We created man from a mingled sperm drop to try him, and We made him hearing and seeing.
Indeed, We have guided him to the way, be he thankful or a staunch denier.
Indeed, We have prepared for the deniers chains and yokes and a blaze.
Indeed, the virtuous drink from a cup whose mixture is camphor—
a spring from which Allah’s servants drink, making it gush abundantly.
They fulfill (their)  vows and fear a day of widespread evil,
and they feed—for the love of Him— (any)  destitute person and (any)   orphan and (any)  captive.
“Indeed, we only feed you  pl   for the sake of Allah; We want from you neither repayment nor thankfulness.
Indeed, we fear from our Lord a frowning, grim day.”
So Allah shielded them from the ills of that day and made them receive radiance and joy
and repaid them for their patience with a Garden (in paradise)  and silk (garments)  ;
reclining therein on couches, they see therein neither (the heat of a)  sun nor freezing cold.
And its shades hover over them, and its clusters (of fruit)  are brought low within reach.
And passing around them are vessels of silver and cups of crystal—
crystalline silver cups—that they measured out with perfect measure.
And they are served in it with a cup whose flavor is a mixture of ginger,
 (from)  a spring therein named Salsabeel.
And passing among them are immortal youths; when you  sg   see them, you think them sprinkled pearls.
And when you  sg   see, you see there bliss and a vast Dominion.
Upon them are  green garments of silk, and  (upon them is)   brocade    ,and they have been adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord has offered them a pure drink.
“Indeed, this is a repayment for you  pl   , and your efforts have been well thanked.”
Indeed, We—We alone—have surely bestowed the Recital  upon you  sg   from on high.
So wait patiently for the judgment of your  sg   Lord, and do not obey any sinner or any staunch denier among them.
And remember  the Name of your  sg   Lord morning and evening,
and for part of the night prostrate yourself to Him, and highly exalt Him long into the night.
Indeed, these  love the fleeting life and leave behind them a heavy day.
We have created them and have strengthened their frame, and whenever We will, We can replace them entirely with others like them.
Indeed, this is a Reminder. So whoever wills, let him take a way to his Lord.
Yet  you   pl    cannot     will , unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah has always been All-Knowing, All- Wise.
He enters into His mercy whomever He wills, and the unjust— He has prepared for them a painful punishment.
