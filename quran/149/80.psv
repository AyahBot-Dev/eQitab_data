He frowned and turned away
when the blind man approached him.
But what could make you  sg   realize that perhaps he was seeking to purify himself,
or to be reminded  so that    the reminder would benefit him?
But as for the one who thought himself self-sufficient,
you  sg   give him your attention,
though you are not liable if he never purifies himself.
Yet, as for the one who came to you rushing
with fear (of Allah)  ,
to him you are inattentive.
But no, indeed this is a Reminder.
So whoever wills shall remember it.
 (It is)  in honorable Scrolls,
exalted and purified,
borne by the hands of scribes,
noble and devoted.
May man perish  ! What a denier he is!
From what did He create him?
From a sperm drop He created him and enabled him,
then He eased the way for him,
then He put him to death and buried him,
then, when He wills, He will resurrect him.
But no, he did not fulfill what He commanded him.
Let man look at his food:
 that We    poured down water in abundance,
then We made the land vigorously rupture
and germinated therein grains
and grapes and herbs,
and olives and dates,
and luscious orchards,
and fruit and fodder—
an enjoyment for you and for your  pl   livestock.
But when the Deafening Noise comes to pass,
on a day when a person flees from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his female companion and his children—
every one of them on that day has enough to preoccupy him.
Some faces on that day are radiant,
laughing and glad.
And some faces on that day are covered with dust,
covered in darkness:
those are the deniers, the vicious.
