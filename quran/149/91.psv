By the sun and its morning shine,
and the moon as it follows her,
and the daytime as it reveals her,
and the night as it conceals her.
By the sky and He Who built it.
By the land and He Who spread it.
By the (inner)  self and He Who formed it
then inspired it its own wickedness and its own mindfulness (of God)  —
surely, successful is the one who has purified it,
and surely, failing is the one who has stunted it.
Exceeding all limits caused Thamûd  to disbelieve,
when the most wicked man among them was delegated.
Then the messenger of Allah  said to them, “This is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink.”
So they disbelieved him and hamstrung her, so their Lord crushed them for their misdeed and leveled it  ,
 and    He does  not fear its ultimate outcome.
