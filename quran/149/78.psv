What are they asking one another about?
About the Great Tiding,
over which they differ.
But no, surely they will find out!
Once again, no, surely they will find out!
Did We not make the earth a resting place,
and the mountains as pegs?
And created you  pl   in pairs?
And made your sleep for rest,
and made the night a garment,
and made the day for livelihood?
And built above you seven strong ones,
and made a glowing lamp?
And brought down from the clouds pouring water,
to bring out with it grains and plants
and luxuriant gardens?
Indeed, the Day of Decision has been appointed:
the day when the Trumpet is blown, and you come in crowds,
and the sky was   opened     up and became gateways,
and the mountains were set in motion and became a mirage.
Indeed, Hell has been lying in ambush—
a destination for those who exceed all limits,
where they  remain    for eons,
tasting therein neither coolness nordrink,
except scalding water and purulence—
a fitting repayment,
for they were not expecting any reckoning,
and they disbelieved Our signs with utter disbelief.
But We have enumerated everything in writing.
So taste, for We will not increase you  pl   except in punishment!
Indeed, for the mindful  pl    (of God)  there is triumph:
Gardens (of Paradise)  and vineyards;
and high-class spouses, well-matched;
and overflowing cups.
They hear therein neither idle talk nor lies—
a repayment from your  sg   Lord, a measured gift,
(from) the Lord    of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, (from)  the All-Merciful. They have no authority from Him to speak
on the day when the Spirit and the angels line up in ranks, not speaking—except whomever the All-Merciful has permitted and who has said what is right.
That is the True Day. So whoever wills, let him take a route to return to his Lord.
Indeed, We have warned you  pl   of a near punishment—the day when a person looks at what his hands have put forth, and the denier says, “If only I were dust!”
