When the sky is ruptured
and listens to its Lord as it rightly must,
and when the earth is leveled out
and casts out what is in it and becomes empty
and listens to its Lord as it rightly must—
O man, you are laboring towards your Lord laboriously, then you are bound to meet Him.
So as for the one who was brought his record  b   in his right hand,
he will have an easy reckoning
and will return to his family joyful.
But as for the one who was brought his record behind his back,
he will call for demise
and  will roast    at the Blaze.
Indeed, he used to be joyful among his family;
indeed, he thought he would never return.
Yes, surely his Lord has always been All-Seeing of him.
So, No! I swear by the twilight.
By the night and what it covers.
By the moon as it grows full—
 you   pl    will     surely mount stage by stage.
So what is the matter with them that they do not believe?
And when the Recital  is recited to them, they do not prostrate themselves?
Rather, the deniers disbelieve,
but Allah knows better what they hide inside.
So give them glad tidings  of a painful punishment—
except for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds; for them is an unfailing reward.
