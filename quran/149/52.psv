By Mount Tûr.
By a scripture inscribed
in an unrolled parchment.
By the frequented House (of God)  .
By the raised canopy.
By the sea flared up with fire—
the punishment of your  sg   Lord is sure to come;
there is nothing to avert it
on the day when the sky sways in agitation
and the mountains go into motion.
So woe on that day to the disbelievers
who are indulged in vain talk, playing.
The day when they are shoved into the Fire of Hell forcefully.
“This is the Fire in which you  pl   used to disbelieve.
Is this magic, or do you  pl   not see?
Roast in it, and be patient or be impatient—it is the same for you  pl   ; indeed, you are only being repaid for what you used to do.”
Indeed, the mindful (of God)  are in Gardens and bliss,
enjoying what their Lord has brought them, and their Lord has shielded them from the punishment of purgatory.
“Eat and drink pleasantly on account of what you  pl   used to do.”
Relaxing on luxurious furnishings, and We coupled them with spouses with lovely wide eyes.
And those who attained faith and  whose offspring     followed them in faith—We have united  them with  their  offspring    , and We have not deprived them of anything of their work; every person is in pledge for what (deeds)  he has earned.
And We have supplied them with fruit and meat such as they desire.
They exchange therein a cup which does not lead to any idle talk or recrimination.
And serving them are youths like nestled pearls.
And they approached one another, inquiring.
They said, “When we were still with our families  we used to live in fear  ,
so Allah has conferred favor upon us and has shielded us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire.
Indeed, before this we used to pray to Him;  indeed ,    He is the Fulfiller of promises, the Bestower of mercy.”
So remind, for you  sg   are neither a soothsayer nor a madman.
Or do they say, “A poet  for whom we await a calamity of time”?
Say  sg   , “Go on awaiting, for I am with you  pl   among those awaiting.”
Or is it that their discerning minds command them to this? Or are they a people who exceed all limits?
Or do they say, “He made it up”? In fact, they do not believe.
So let them produce a discourse like it if they are truthful.
Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they are not certain.
Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord? Or are they the controllers?
Or do they have a stairway (to heaven)  by means of which they listen? Then let their listener bring an evident manifestation.
Or is He to have the daughters and you  pl   the sons?
Or do you  sg   ask them for a reward so that they are weighed down by debt?
Or do they have (knowledge of)  the hidden realm and they are writing it down?
Or do they want a plot? Rather, the plot will only befall the deniers.
Or do they have a god other than Allah? Highly Exalted is Allah above what they associate.
And if they were to see lumps of sky falling, they would say, “A mass of clouds.”
So leave  sg   them until  they meet    their day in which they are stunned—
the day when their plots avail them nothing, nor are they supported.
And indeed, for those who did injustice there is a punishment apart from that, but most of them do not know.
So wait patiently for the decree of your  sg   Lord, for you are before Our Eyes. And highly exalt your Lord with praise when you arise,
and highly exalt Him during the night and at the receding of the stars.
