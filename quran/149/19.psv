Kāf, Hā Yā, ‘Ain, Sād.
A reminder of your sg Lord’s mercy towards His servant Zechariah,
when he called out to his Lord a call in seclusion.
He said, “My Lord, my bones have become feeble and my hair is aflame with gray, and never, in calling upon You my Lord, have I been wretched.
And indeed, I am afraid of what my protégés will do when I am gone, for my wife has always been barren. So grant me from Yourself a guardian
to inherit from me and inherit from Jacob’s folk, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”
“O Zechariah, indeed, We give you glad tidings of a boy whose name is John; We have never made anyone similar to him before.”
He said, “My Lord, how can I have a boy when my wife has always been barren and I have become decrepit with old age?”
He said, “Thus said your Lord, ‘It is easy for Me, and I have certainly created you before when you were nothing.’”
He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you do not speak to people for three nights, (despite) being in perfect shape.”
So he came out to his people from the sanctuary and signaled to them to exalt (God) , morning and evening.
“O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,” and We gave him wise judgment in his youth
and tenderness from Us and purity, and he was mindful (of God) ,
and was very kind to his parents, and he was never a disobedient coercer.
And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is resurrected alive.
And remember sg in the Scripture Mary, when she secluded herself from her family in an eastern location.
And she took a cover for herself away from them, and We sent to her Our spirit, so He appeared to her as a human being in perfect shape.
She said, “I seek refuge from you with the All-Merciful, if you are mindful (of God) .”
He said, “I am only a messenger of your Lord to grant you a pure boy.”
She said, “How can I have a boy when no human being has touched me, nor have I ever been a harlot?”
He said, “Thus said your Lord, ‘It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us, and it has been a matter already decreed.’”
So she carried him and secluded herself with him in a remote place.
Then the birth pangs compelled her to come to the trunk of the palm tree. She said, “If only I had died before this and been a thing forgotten, completely forgotten!”
 So he called her from beneath her : “Be not sad; your Lord has made a stream beneath you.
And shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you— it will drop ripe dates upon you.”
“So eat and drink and let your eye be comforted, but if you see any human being, say, ‘I have vowed a fast to the All-Merciful, so I will not speak to any human today.’”
Then she came to her people, carrying him. They said, “O Mary, you have done something terrible.
O sister of Aaron , neither was your father an evil man, nor was your mother a harlot.”
So she pointed to him. They said, “How can we speak to an infant in the cradle?”
He said, “I am Allah’s servant. He has brought me the Scripture and has made me a prophet.
And He has made me blessed wherever I may be and has enjoined upon me prayer and purifying charity so long as I live.
And He has made me very kind to my mother and has not made me a wretched coercer.
And peace be upon me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I get resurrected alive.”
That is Jesus, son of Mary —the word of truth about which they are skeptical.
Never was it for Allah to have any offspring—Highly Exalted is He; whenever He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and so it is.
“And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your pl Lord, so worship Him; this is a straight path.”
But the parties differed among themselves, so woe to those who have denied from the spectacle of a great day.
How well they shall hear and see on the day they come to Us! But the unjust are today in evident misguidance.
And warn sg them of the Day of Regret, when the matter has been concluded. Yet they are in oblivion, and they do not believe.
Indeed, We—We alone—will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and to Us they are returned .
And mention sg in the Scripture Abraham; he was indeed an unwavering believer (and) a prophet.
Recall when he said to his father, “O my father, why do you worship what can neither hear nor see nor avail you anything?
O my father, most surely there has come to me of knowledge what has never come to you, so follow me and I will guide you to a straight path.
O my father, do not worship Satan; indeed Satan has always been disobedient to the All-Merciful.
O my father, indeed I fear that a punishment from the All-Merciful may touch you so that you would become an ally for Satan.”
He said, “Are you renouncing my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will certainly stone you, so leave me for a long while.”
He said, “Peace be upon you; I will ask my Lord to forgive you; indeed, He has always been gracious to me.
And I shall withdraw from you pl and from what you pl call upon apart from Allah, and I will call upon my Lord; hopefully, in calling upon my Lord, I shall never be wretched.”
So when he withdrew from them and what they worshiped apart from Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a prophet.
And We granted them of Our mercy and gave them a high and true renown.
And mention sg in the Scripture Moses. He was indeed a sincere, chosen one , and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.
And We called out to him from the right side of Mount Tûr, and brought him near in communion.
And We granted him, of Our mercy, his brother Aaron as a prophet.
And mention in the Scripture Ishmael; he was indeed true to his promise, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.
And he used to command his family to prayer and purifying charity , and with his Lord he was always rendered pleased.
And mention in the Scripture Enoch; he was indeed an unwavering believer (and) a prophet.
And We raised him to a high position.
Those are the ones whom Allah blessed ofthe prophets from the offspring of Adam, and from those We carried with Noah, and from the offspring of Abraham and Israel, and from those We guided and selected. Whenever the signs of the All-Merciful b were recited to them, they would fall down prostrating and weeping.
Then they were succeeded by generations who wasted the prayers and followed desires, and thus they will encounter (the sequel of their) delusion—
except for whoever repented and believed and acted righteously, for those shall enter the Garden and shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way—
the Gardens of Eden which have been promised by the All-Merciful to His servants in the hidden realm; indeed, His promise has ever been coming true.
Therein they hear no idle talk, but only peace. And therein they have their own provision, morning and evening.
Such is the Garden (of Paradise) which We give as inheritance to whoever of Our servants who has been mindful (of God) .
“And we do not descend except by the command of your sg Lord; to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between them, and your Lord has never been forgetful.”
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, so worship Him and persevere in worshiping Him. Do you know of anyone similar to Him?
And man says, “ Can it be that when I am dead, I will be brought out alive?”
Does man not remember that We created him earlier when he was nothing?
By your sg Lord, We will surely herd them and the devils, then We will surely bring them around Hell on their knees.
Then out of every sect We will surely snatch those most defiant to the All-Merciful.
Then (they will realize that) We surely know better of those who are most deserving to roast in it.
But every single one of you is bound to approach it; this has been an unavoidable decree of your Lord.
Then We deliver those who were mindful (of God) and leave the unjust in it on their knees.
And when Our signs are read to them, evident, those who have denied say to those who have attained faith, “Which of the two groups is better in position and fairer in company?”
And how many a generation have We annihilated before them who surpassed them in riches and splendor?
Say sg , “Whoever has been in utter misguidance, may the All-Merciful fully extend for him .” Until, when they see what they were promised—either punishment or the Hour—then they will know who was in a worse position and weaker as an army.
And Allah increases in guidance those who seek guidance. And abiding deeds of righteousness are more rewardable by your Lord and better in return.
Have you sg seen the one who denied Our signs and said, “I will most surely be given wealth and children”?
Has he viewed the hidden realm, or has he taken with the All-Merciful a covenant?
But no! We will write what he says and keep extending the agony for him exceedingly,
and we will inherit from him whatever he says, and he will come to Us solitary.
And they took, apart from Allah, other gods to be a source of might for them.
But no! They will deny their worship of them and become opponents against them.
Have you sg not seen that We have dispatched the devils against the deniers, exciting them with incitement?
So do not hurry about them; indeed, We are only counting (down) for them precisely.
On a day when We herd the ones who were mindful (of God) to the All-Merciful f as a delegation,
and flock the criminals into Hell, thirsty,
with no power of intercession—except for the one who had taken with the All-Merciful a covenant.
And they said, “The All-Merciful has taken (for himself) offspring.”
You have pl come up with something monstrous!
The heavens almost rupture at it, and the earth splits and the mountains fall, crumbling:
that they have attributed a son to the All-Merciful!
And in no way is it fitting for the All-Merciful to take (for Himself) a son.
There is none in the heavens and the earth but is bound to come to the All-Merciful as a servant.
He has enumerated them and counted them precisely.
And each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day of Resurrection solitary.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—the All-Merciful will give them love.
So indeed, We have made it easy in your sg tongue, that you may give glad tidings to the ones who were mindful (of God) and warn with it a hostile people.
And how many a generation have We annihilated before them? Can you feel a single one of them or hear from them the slightest whisper?
