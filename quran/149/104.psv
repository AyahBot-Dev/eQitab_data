Woe to every slandering backbiter,
who hoarded wealth and counted it over,
thinking that his wealth has made him immortal.
But no! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher.
And what can make you realize what the Crusher is?
Allahâ€™s kindled Fire
that mounts over burning hearts.
Indeed, it is over them with no exit,
in extended columns.
