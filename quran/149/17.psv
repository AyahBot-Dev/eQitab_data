Highly Exalted is the One Who took His servant on a journey by night from the Inviolable Mosque to the Farthest Mosque , whose precincts We a have blessed, in order to show him of Our signs; indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.
And We brought Moses the Scripture and made it guidance for the Children of Israel : “Take none for trustee other than Me,
 (O) offspring of those We carried with Noah; indeed, he was a constantly thankful servant.”
And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: “You will most surely corrupt in the land twice, and you will most surely rise to a great height.
Then when the promise of the first of the two times came true, We sent against you pl servants of Ours possessing intense force, and they ransacked the homes, and it was a promise fulfilled.”
Then We gave you pl back your turn against them and supplied you with wealth and offspring and made you more numerous.
If you excel in doing good, you excel in doing good to your own benefit; and if you do evil, you do so against yourselves. Then when the promise of the second time comes true, they will defile your faces, and they will enter the Mosque as they entered it the first time, and they will utterly destroy all that falls into their power.
Hopefully your pl Lord will have mercy on you. But if you revert, We will revert. And We have made Hell a prison for the deniers.
Indeed, this Recital guides to what is most upright and gives glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that for them there is a supreme reward,
and that those who do not believe in the Hereafter—We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
And man calls for evil as he calls for good, and man has always been very hasty.
And We have made the night and the day as two signs, then We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day as an eye-opener, that you pl may seek grace from your Lord and that you may learn the number of years and the calculation; and everything have We explained in detail.
And for every person We have attached his augury to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection We will bring out for him a record which he will find spread open .
“Recite sg your record; today your own self is sufficient as a reckoner.”
Whoever is guided—he is only guided to his own benefit, while whoever goes astray—he goes astray to his own detriment. And no bearer of burden carries the burden of another, for never do We punish until We have sent a messenger.
And when We want to annihilate a town We command its affluent ones (to be righteous) , yet they defiantly disobey (Our commands) in it, so it deserves the decree and We annihilate it completely.
And how many generations have We annihilated after Noah? Thus sufficient is your Lord as All-Aware, All-Seeing of the misdeeds of His servants.
Whoever has been wanting the hasty (life of this world) —We hasten for him therein whatever We will to whomever We desire. Then We assigned for him Hell where he roasts, condemned, defeated.
But whoever wanted the Hereafter and, as a believer, pursued it as it should be pursued, those—their pursuit has always been thanked.
To all—these and these (as well) —We extend from the gifts of your sg Lord b , for the gifts of your Lord have never been restricted.
Look sg at how We have favored some of them over others, yet the Hereafter is more superior in degrees (of rank) and more superior in preference.
Do sg not set up another god with Allah, lest you remain condemned,damned.
And your sg Lord has decreed that you pl shall worship none but Him, and (He has decreed) excelling in doing good to both parents. If either of them or both of them reach old age with you sg , then do not say to them “Fie” nor scold them, but speak to them using noble words.
And lower to them the wing of humility, out of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy on both of them as they raised me when I was a child.”
Your pl Lord knows better what is within yourselves. If you are righteous—indeed, He has always been Oft-Forgiving to the ones who often turn (to Him) .
And give sg the relative his rights, and the destitute sg and the traveler in need, and do not squander wastefully.
Indeed, the squanderers have always been brethren of the Satans, for Satan has always been a staunch denier of his Lord.
But if you sg disregard them, seeking mercy which you expect from your Lord, then speak to them using gentle words.
And do not keep your hand tied to your neck nor spread it out fully, lest you end up blamed, regretful.
Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whomever He wills and He restrains (it) ; indeed, He has always been All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.
And do pl not kill your children for fear of poverty; We provide for them and for you pl . Indeed, killing them has always been a grave offense.
And do pl not come near fornication; indeed, it is an obscenity and an evil way.
And do pl not kill the self which Allah has made inviolable, except in the course of justice. And if someone is killed unjustly, We have given authority to his kinsman who seeks retribution, but he should not be excessive in killing; indeed, he is bound to be aided.
And do pl not come near the orphan’s wealth except with that which is better (for him) , until he has attained his full strength. And fulfill every covenant; indeed, the covenant has always been a responsibility.
And give pl full measure when you measure, and weigh with accurate scales; that is fair and the best determination.
And do sg not follow what you have no knowledge of; indeed, the hearing and the sight and the burning heart—all of those— (one) is bound to be questioned about.
And do sg not walk merrily on earth; you sg will surely not pierce the earth, nor will you match the mountains in height.
All of that — its evil has always been disliked by your Lord .
That is some of the wisdom your sg Lord has revealed to you. And do not set up with Allah another god, lest you be thrown in Hell, blamed, banished.
Has your pl Lord favored you with sons and taken for Himself from the angels females? You pl are certainly saying a great saying.
And very truly, We have explained in this Recital in various ways, that they may constantly remember , but it only adds to their aversion.
Say sg , “If there were other gods with Him as they say , they would have sought a way to the Possessor of the Throne.”
Highly Exalted is He. He is Most High, far above what they say.
Exalting Him are the seven heavens and the earth and whoever is in them. And there is not a thing that does not exalt Him with praise, but you pl do not comprehend their exaltation. Indeed, He has always been Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.
And when you sg recite the Recital , We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible barrier.
And We have placed veils over their hearts preventing them from comprehending it, and heaviness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Recital a , they turn their backs in aversion.
We know better what (intention) it is that they listen with as they listen to you and as they secretly converse, as the unjust say, “You pl are following nothing but a man bewitched.”
Look sg at how they have set forth parables for you sg and gone astray, so they cannot find a way.
And they said, “ Can it be that when we have become bones and fragments— can it be that we will really be resurrected as a new creation?”
Say sg , “ Become pl rocks or iron
or any sort of creation which is greatly admired in your pl chests.” Then they will say, “Who will restore us?” Say sg , “The One Who originated you pl the first time.” Then they will nod their heads at you sg and say, “When will it be?” Say, “Hopefully, it will be soon,
on the day when He calls you pl , then you respond with His praise and you think that you stayed only a little.”
And tell sg My servants to say what is better. Indeed, Satan spurs (discord) between them; indeed, Satan has always been, to man, an evident enemy.
Your pl Lord knows better about you. If He wills, He bestows mercy on you; and if He wills, He punishes you. Thus We never sent you sg as a trustee over them.
And your sg Lord knows better about whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have most surely favored some prophets over others, and to David We gave a Book .
Say, “Call upon those you claimed apart from Him. But they have no power to lift off harm from you, nor can they change it.”
Those whom they call upon are themselves seeking means of access to their Lord—whichever of them will be nearer—and hoping for His mercy and fearing His punishment; indeed, the punishment of your Lord has always been dreaded.
So there is no town but We are to annihilate it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment; this has been inscribed in the Scripture.
And nothing prevented Us from sending (miraculous) signs except that the ancients disbelieved in them. So We gave Thamûd the she-camel as an eye-opener, but they mistreated it. For We never send signs except to frighten (people of destruction) .
And recall when We said to you sg that your Lord has encompassed mankind. And We did not make the vision We showed you except as a means of trial for mankind, and (recall) the tree which is cursed in the Recital . And We frighten them, but that increases them in nothing but supreme transgression.
And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” so they prostrated—but not Iblis . He said, “Shall I prostrate down to someone You created of clay?”
He said, “Do You see this one whom You have honored more than me? If You reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection, I will most surely bridle his offspring, except for a few.”
He said, “Go! Whoever of them follows you—then indeed, Hell is your pl repayment, an ample repayment.
And entice whomever of them youcan with your voice, and rally against them your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and promise them.” But Satan promises them nothing but a deception.
“You surely have no authority over My servants.” And sufficient is your Lord as a trustee.
Your pl Lord is the One Who propels for you the ships at sea, that you may seek of His grace; indeed, to you He has always been Merciful.
And when harm touches you pl at sea, (all) those you call upon become lost except for Him. But when He delivered you to the shore, you disregarded (Him) ; thus man has always been a staunch denier.
Are you pl confident that He will not cause a side of the shore to collapse beneath you or unleash a tornado against you, and then you find no trustee?
Or are you pl confident that He will not return you to it once again and unleash a hurricane of wind against you and drown you for your denial, and then you find no attending followers against Us?
Yet very truly We have honored the Children of Adam and carried them on land and sea and provided them with good things and greatly favored them over many of those We have created.
On the day when We call every group of people by their leader, then whoever is given his record in his right hand—those will read their record, and they will not be dealt with unjustly by as much as the hair upon a date-stone.
But whoever is blind in this (life) —he will be blind in the Hereafter and further astray from the way.
And they almost lured you sg away from what We have revealed to you so that you would fabricate something else in Our name, and in that case they would have taken you for a close friend.
Had We not given you sg stability, you were about to incline towards them a little.
Then We would have made you sg taste double in life and double at death, then you would have found for yourself no supporter against Us.
They almost provoked you sg so as to evict you from the land, and in that case they would not have lasted after you except briefly;
such has been Our rule with the messengers We have sent before you, and you never find any change in Our rule.
Establish sg the prayer at the decline of the sun until the dusk of the night, as well as the Recitation at dawn; indeed, Recitation at dawn has always been witnessed.
And keep vigil with it during parts of the night as an extra (deed) ; hopefully your sg Lord will raise you to a laudable position.
And say sg , “My Lord, let me enter through an entry of truth and let me exit through an exit of truth and grant me from You a supporting manifestation.”
And say sg , “Truth has come while falsehood has withered away; indeed, falsehood is bound to wither away.”
And We bestow from on high of the Recital d that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the unjust except in loss.
And when We bless man, he disregards (Us) and distances himself . But when evil touches him, he staunchly despairs.
Say, “Each does according to his disposition, but your pl Lord knows better of the one who is more guided to the way.”
And they ask you sg about the Spirit; say, “The Spirit is by the command of my Lord, and you pl were not given of knowledge but little.”
And if We will, we can surely take away what We have revealed to you sg , then you would find for yourself no trustee against Us—
except through a mercy from your Lord ; indeed, His grace upon you has been supreme.
Say, “Most surely, if all humans and all unseen beings were to come together to bring forth the like of this Recital , they could never bring forth the like of it, even if they backed up one another.”
And most surely, We have diversified for mankind in this Recital c every kind of parable, but most of mankind refused anything but constant denial.
And they said, “We will not believe in you sg until you make a spring gush forth from the ground for us;
or possess a garden of palms and vines, then cause rivers to gush forth, pouring through them;
or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you claimed; or bring Allah and the angels before us;
or possess a house of gold; or ascend into the sky. Even then, we will not believe in your ascension until you bestow upon us from on high a scripture that we can read.” Say, “Highly Exalted is my Lord. Have I been anything except a human messenger?”
And what prevented mankind from believing when guidance came to them, except that they said, “Did Allah send a human messenger?”
 Say , “If there were angels on earth walking around in peace, We would have bestowed upon them from heaven an angel messenger.”
Say, “Allah is an adequate witness between you and me; indeed, He has always been All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.”
And whomever Allah guides is the guided one, and whomever He leads astray—for them you will find no guardians apart from Him, and We will herd them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf; their shelter is Hell; whenever it abates, We intensify the blaze for them.
That is their repayment for having denied Our signs and for having said, “ Can it be that when we have become bones and fragments— can it be that we will really be resurrected as a new creation?”
Have they not seen that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, is Able to create the likes of them? And He has assigned for them a term in which there is no doubt. But the unjust refused anything but constant denial.
Say, “If you pl were to possess the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would withhold them for fear of spending (them) .” And man has always been stingy.
And very truly We gave Moses nine evident signs, so ask the Children of Israel about when he went to them, then Pharaoh said to him, “Indeed, I think that you, O Moses, are bewitched.”
He said, “ You sg have most surely known that nonesent these down except the Lord of the heavens and the earth, (as) insights. And indeed I think that you, O Pharaoh, are doomed to demise.”
So he wanted to provoke them to leave the land, but We drowned him and those with him, all together.
And after him, We said to the Children of Israel, “Settle in the land; yet when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We will bring you forth in a mixed multitude.”
And with the truth We sent it down, and with the truth it descended. Thus We have not sent you but as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner.
And a Recital which We apportioned, that you sg may recite it to mankind leisurely. And We surely bestowed it from on high.
Say sg , “Believe in it or do not believe.” Indeed, those who were brought knowledge before it—when it is recited to them, they fall to their chins, prostrating.
And they say, “Highly Exalted is our Lord. The promise of our Lord is sure to be fulfilled.”
And they fall to their chins weeping, and it adds to their humility.
Say sg , “Call upon Allah or call upon the All-Merciful; whichever you call upon, to Him belong the most beautiful names.” And be neither loud in your prayer nor silent in it, but follow a way in between.
And say sg , “All praise be to Allah, Who has not taken any offspring (for Himself) , nor has He ever had an associate in the dominion, nor has He ever had an ally out of humbleness. And glorify Him constantly.”
