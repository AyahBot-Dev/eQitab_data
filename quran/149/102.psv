Vying for more distracted you pl 
until you visited the graves.
But no! You pl will come to know.
Once again: But no! You pl will come to know.
But no! If only you pl knew with the knowledge of certitude:
you will certainly see purgatory.
Then you pl will certainly see it with the eye of certitude.
Then, on that day, you pl will certainly be asked about (worldly) bliss.
