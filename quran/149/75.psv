 No !  I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
And, no! I swear by the reproaching (inner)  self.
Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones?
Yes indeed; We are Able to form his very fingertips.
Rather, man wants to commit vice ever onward.
He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrection?”
So, when the sight  is dazzled    ,
and the moon is eclipsed,
and the sun and the moon are joined together—
man says on that day, “Where is the escape?”
But no! There is no refuge.
To your  sg   Lord on that day everything comes to reside.
Man is informed on that day of whatever he put forth and whatever he left behind.
Rather, man is an eyewitness against himself,
even as he presents his excuses.
Do not rush your  sg   tongue with it  to hurry on with it.
Indeed, upon Us is its collection and its recitation.
So, when We have recited it, follow  sg   its recitation;
then upon Us is its explanation.
But no! Rather,  you   pl    love the fleeting life 
 and you     leave aside the Hereafter.
Some faces on that day are radiant,
looking towards their Lord.
And some faces on that day are gloomy,
expecting that a back-breaking blow will be dealt them.
But no! Rather, when it  has reached the collarbone,
and it is said, “Who is the healer?”
And one realizes that it is the final departure,
and leg is entwined with leg  —
to your  sg   Lord on that day is the driving (of people)  .
Then, (as for)  one who neither believed nor prayed,
but disbelieved and turned away,
then went to his family, strutting—
 (this punishment is)  more and more suitable for you  sg   .
Then again, more and more suitable for you.
Does man think that he will be left without purpose?
Was he not  a drop of emitted semen  ?
Then he became a clinging form, which He then created and formed?
And made of him the two spouses  , the male and the female?
Is not that One Able to revive the dead?
