Those who have denied from among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted (from disbelief) until the evident proof came to them—
a messenger from Allah reading purified Scrolls;
in them are valuable scriptures.
Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided except after the evident proof came to them.
And they were only commanded to worship Allah—devoting religion to Him, turning away from all that is false—and to establish the prayer and to bring the purifying charity , and that is the religion most upright.
Indeed, those who have denied among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists are in the fire of Hell, abiding therein; those are the worst of all beings.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—those are the best of all beings.
Their repayment with their Lord: Gardens of Eternity beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah became well pleased with them and they became well pleased with Him. That is for whoever was in awe of his Lord.
