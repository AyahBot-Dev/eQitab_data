Tâ Ha.
We have not sent down the Recital upon you sg for you to be wretched,
but only as a reminding for one who fears.
A bestowal from on high by the One Who created the earth and the highest heavens—
the All-Merciful; on the Throne He settled .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the ground.
And if you sg speak aloud, indeed, He knows the secret and the most hidden.
Allah—there is no god but He; to him belong the most beautiful names.
And has the story of Moses reached you sg ?
When he saw a fire, so he said to his family, “Stay; I have noticed a fire; perhaps I can bring you pl a torch therefrom or find some guidance by the fire.”
So when he reached it, he was called, “O Moses.
Indeed, I—I am your Lord. So take off your sandals; you are indeed in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
And I have chosen you , so listen to what is revealed.
Indeed I—I alone—am Allah. There is no God but I, so worship Me and establish the prayer for My remembrance.
The Hour is indeed coming—I almost hide it—so that every single self is paid for what it endeavors.
So let not the one who denies it and has been following his own whim bar you from it, lest you fall (into doom) .
And what is that in your right-hand, O Moses?”
He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and I beat down (leaves) for my sheep with it, and I have other uses for it.”
He said, “Cast it, O Moses.”
So he cast it, and thereupon it became a moving serpent.
He said, “Pick it up and be not afraid; We will restore it to its original condition.
And press your hand to your side; it will come out white without any bad affliction—another sign,
that We may show you of Our greatest signs.
Go to Pharaoh; indeed, he has exceeded all limits.”
He said, “My Lord, expand my chest for me,
and ease my mission for me,
and untie the knot from my tongue
so that they can comprehend my speech,
and appoint for me an assistant from my family:
Aaron, my brother; 
 strengthen me with him
 and associate him with me in my mission ,
that we may exalt You much
and remember You much.
Indeed, You have always been All-Seeing of us.”
He said, “You sg have been granted your request, O Moses.
And most surely, We have conferred favor upon you on another occasion,
when We revealed to your mother what was revealed:
‘Throw him in the coffer then throw it into the waters, so that the waters will cast it onto the bank where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will pick him up.’ For I bestowed upon you love from Me and so that you may be modeled before My eye.
Recall your sister walking along and saying, ‘Shall I tell you about someone who can foster him?’ So We returned you to your mother, that her eye may be comforted and (that she may) not grieve. And you killed a person, but We delivered you from stress and We tested you thoroughly. Then you stayed for years among the people of Midian. Then you came as ordained, O Moses.
And I modeled you for Myself.
Go sg , you and your brother, with My signs, and do dl not slacken in remembering Me.
Go dl to Pharaoh—he has indeed exceeded all limits—
but say dl a lenient word to him, that he may remind himself or be fearful.”
They said, “Our Lord, we fear he may persecute us or exceed all limits.”
He said, “Be not afraid; I am indeed with you dl , hearing and seeing.
So approach dl him and say, `We dl are the messengers of your Lord, so send the Children of Israel with us and do not punish them; we have surely brought you a sign from your Lord, for peace is upon whoever has followed the guidance.
It has indeed been revealed to us that punishment falls upon whoever has disbelieved andturned away.’”
He said, “So who is your dl Lord, O Moses?”
He said, “Our Lord is the One Who gave everything its creation then guided (it) .”
He said, “So what about the former generations?”
He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record ; my Lord never goes astray nor does He forget.”
 (He is) the One Who has made the earth a cradle for you pl and traced in it ways for you pl , and sent down from the sky water with which We brought out pairs of diverse plants.
Eat pl and pasture your livestock. Most surely, in that are signs for ones endowed with intelligence.
From it We created you pl , and into it We return you, and from it We bring you out once again.
And very truly We showed him all of Our signs, but he disbelieved and refused.
He said, “Have you come to us to evict us from our land with your sorcery, O Moses?
We will most surely bring you sorcery like it; so make between us and you an appointment which we will not break —neither us nor you—in a suitable place.”
He said, “Your pl appointment is the day of the festival, so let the people be herded together at forenoon.”
Then Pharaoh turned away and put together his plot, and then he came.
Moses said to them, “Woe to you pl . Do not fabricate lies against Allah or He will destroy you pl with a punishment, and surely, the one who fabricates lies is bound to fail.”
Then they disagreed with each other about their matter and conversed secretly.
They said, “ These two are nothing but sorcerers who want to evict you from your land with their sorcery and abolish your exemplary way of life.
So decide your pl plot, then come, lined up (in ranks) ; and the one who gains the upper hand is surely bound to succeed today.”
They said, “O Moses, either you cast or we will be the first to cast.”
He said, “Rather, you pl cast.” And suddenly, their ropes and staffs were made to appear to him, because of their sorcery, to be slithering.
So Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
We said, “Be not afraid; you sg are the highest.
And cast what is in your right hand— it will swallow what they have crafted; what they have crafted is only a sorcerer’s trickery, for the sorcerer will not succeed wherever he may go.”
So the sorcerers fell down prostrate. They said, “We have attained faith in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”
He said, “Have you pl attained faith in him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief who has taught you sorcery. So I will most surely cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will most surely crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees. Then you will most surely know which of us is more severe in punishment and more lasting.”
They said, “We will not prefer you over what has come to us of evident proofs nor (over) the One Who originated us, so decree whatever you decree; you can only decree for this Earlier Life.
We have indeed attained faith in our Lord so that He may forgive us our offenses and what you have compelled us to practice of sorcery, for Allah is better and more lasting.”
Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal, then surely for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.
But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done righteous deeds, then for those are the highest degrees (of rank) :
Gardens of Perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein, for that is the repayment of the one who purifies himself.
And very truly, We revealed to Moses: “Journey by night with My servants and strike for them a dry road across the sea. You will not be afraid of being overtaken nor apprehensive.”
So Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but there overwhelmed them of the waters that which overwhelmed them.
Thus Pharaoh led his people astray and never did he guide (them) .
O Children of Israel, We have surely saved you from your enemy, and have made an appointment with you by the right side of Mount Tûr, and sent down to you manna and quails.
Eat of the good things We have provided for you pl , but do not exceed the limits in it lest you deserve My wrath upon you, for the one upon whom My wrath is deserved has surely fallen.
And very truly I am Forgiving towards the one who repented and attained faith and acted righteously and then remained guided.
“And what made you rush ahead of your people, O Moses?”
He said, “They are following in my footsteps. And I hurried on to You, my Lord, that You may be well pleased.”
He said, “Yet, We have surely tested your people in your absence, and the Samiri led them astray.”
So Moses returned to his people, wrathful (and) sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Was the (time of the) covenant too long for you? Or did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon you, so you broke your promise to me?”
They said, “We did not break our promise to you by our choice, but we were made to carry burdens of the people’s ornaments, so we cast them and so did the Samiri cast.”
So he brought out for them a calf—a mere body with a lowing sound. And they said, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten.”
Do they not see that it cannot return a word to them, nor does it possess for them harm or benefit?
And Aaron had most surely said to them before, “O my people, you are indeed being tested by this, and indeed your Lord is the All-Merciful, so follow me and obey my command.”
They said, “We will not give up consecrating it until Moses returns to us.”
He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,
from following me? Have you disobeyed my command?”
He said, “O son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard nor by my head; I feared you would say, ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel and have not regarded my word.’”
He said, “What do you have to say, O Samiri?”
He said, “I perceived what they did not perceive , so I grasped a handful from the messenger’s traces and I flung it away, and thus my soul prompted me.”
He said, “Be gone! For indeed your lot in this life is to say, ‘No touching’, and indeed you have an appointment that you will not be allowed to break . And look at your god that you kept consecrating—we will certainly burn it up then blow it away completely into the waters.”
Surely your pl god is none but Allah, the One besides Whom there is no other god; He has embraced everything in knowledge.
Thus We narrate to you sg of the stories that have passed before, for We have brought you a Reminder from Us.
Whoever has disregarded it will indeed carry on the Day of Resurrection a burden,
abiding pl in it, and how bad their load became on the Day of Resurrection—
the day when the Trumpet is blown ! And We herd the criminals on that day, blue,
murmuring among themselves: “You pl have stayed only for ten.”
We know better what they say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct says, “You pl have stayed for no more than a day.”
And they ask you about the mountains. So say, “My Lord will blow them away
and leave them as desolate waste.
You will see in them neither crookedness nor deviation.”
On that day, they follow the caller without any crookedness, and voices were d (hushed) in reverence to the All-Merciful, so that you sg hear nothing but a murmur.
On that day, intercession does not avail except for the one permitted by the All-Merciful, and He was pleased for him to speak.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot encompass Him with knowledge.
And faces were humbled d to the Living One, the All-Sustaining, and surely whoever carried injustice is bound to fail.
But whoever does righteous deeds while being a believer, then he neither fears injustice nor curtailment.
And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Recital , and We have diversified the warnings in it, that perhaps they would become mindful (of God) or it would bring about in them a remembrance.
Most high above all is Allah, the True King. Do sg not be hasty with the Recital before its revel ation to you is concluded , and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”
And most surely We covenanted with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no resolve.
And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam.” So they prostrated themselves— but not Iblis ; he refused.
So We said, “O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your spouse. So do not let him get you dl out of the Garden, for then you sg will suffer.
In it, indeed, you sg will never go hungry nor be naked.
Nor will you be thirsty in it nor will you swelter.”
But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immortality and a kingdom that never decays?”
So they dl ate from it, whereupon their private parts became exposed to them, and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and was deluded.
Then his Lord recalled him and granted him repentance and accepted it from him and guided (him) .
He said, “Descend from it, all together, some of you as enemies of some others. But whenever guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor suffer.
But whoever has disregarded My Reminder—for him is a miserable life, and We will herd him on the Day of Resurrection blind.”
He said, “My Lord, why did You herd me blind though I used to see?”
He said, “Just as Our signs came to you sg and you forgot them, today you will be forgotten.”
And thus We repay the one who was an extremist and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And surely the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.
Did it give them no guidance (to learn) how many generations before them We annihilated, amidst whose residences they walk? Indeed, in that are signs for the ones endowed with intelligence.
And were it not for a word that had preceded from your sg Lord, the inevitable would have happened, but (there is) a stated term.
So bear patiently what they say and exalt your sg Lord with praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and during the hours of the night exalt Him, and at the (two) ends of the day, that you may be well pleased .
And never extend your eyes towards what We have given some classes of them to enjoy—the splendor of the Earlier Life—that We may test them thereby, for your Lord’s provision is better and more lasting.
And command your people to prayer, and patiently adhere to it; We ask of you sg no provision; it is We who provide for you. For the future outcome is for mindfulness (of God) .
And they said, “If only he were to bring us a sign from his Lord!” Were they not given evidence of whatever is in the former scrolls?
Had We annihilated them with a punishment before him, they would have said, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger so that we would have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and disgraced.”
Say sg , “Everybody is waiting, so wait pl , for you will know who the people of the even path are and who was rightly-guided.
