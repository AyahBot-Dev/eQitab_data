By those  that run panting,
then by those igniting sparks,
then by those raiding at dawn,
raising clouds of dust
and storming into the midst of the crowd—
indeed, man is certainly ungrateful to his Lord;
and indeed, he certainly bears witness to that;
and indeed, in his love for wealth he is certainly fierce.
Does he not know that when whatever lies within the graves is scattered around,
and when whatever lies within the hearts is obtained—
indeed, on that day, their Lord is most surely aware of them.
