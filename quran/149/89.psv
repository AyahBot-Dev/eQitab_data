By the dawn.
By the ten nights.
By the even and the odd.
By the night as it passes—
is there in that a sworn oath for whoever has a mind  ?
Have you  sg   not seen what your Lord did to ʻĀd  —
Iram, (the city)  of the pillars
whose like has never been created in the lands;
and Thamûd  , who carved the rocks in the valley;
and Pharaoh of the stakes?
They (all)  exceeded all limits in the lands
and spread much corruption therein,
so your  sg   Lord poured down upon them a scourge of punishment;
indeed, your Lord is certainly ever-watchful.
So, as for man, whenever his Lord tries him through honoring and blessing him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”
But whenever He tries him through  restricting    his provision, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.”
But no! Rather,  you   pl    do not honor     the orphan, 
 and you do not urge one another     to  (serve)   food to the destitute   sg    , 
 and you devour inheritance  (of the vulnerable)   greedily, 
 and you love wealth immensely.
But no! When the earth is pounded to dust, pounding after pounding;
and your  sg   Lord comes with the angels, rank after rank;
and on that day, Hell is made to come forward—on that day man reminds himself, but how will reminding avail him?
He says, “If only I had put forth something (good)  for my life.”
On that day, none  can punish as He punishes    ,
 and none can shackle as He shackles .
O you tranquil self,
return to your Lord, well pleased and well pleasing;
so enter among My servants,
and enter My Garden.
