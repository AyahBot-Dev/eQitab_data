Woe to the defrauders:
those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full;
but when they measure or weigh to others, they give less than they should.
Do those not think that they will be resurrected
on a great day,
a day when mankind stands before the Lord of all realms?
But no, indeed the record  of the wicked is in Sijjeen  .
And what can make you  sg   realize what Sijjeen is?
A written record  d   .
Woe on that day to the disbelievers
who disbelieve in the Day of Recompense,
for none disbelieves in it except every sinful transgressor
who, when Our signs  are recited to him, says, “Legends of the ancients.”
But no, rather, encrusted over their hearts is what they used to earn.
But no, indeed on that day they are sure to be screened off from their Lord.
Then indeed, they are sure to roast in purgatory.
Then it will be said, “This is what you used to disbelieve in.”
But no, indeed the record  d   of the virtuous is in Elliyyeen  .
And what can make you  sg   realize what Elliyyoon  is?
A written record  ,
witnessed by those brought near.
Indeed, the virtuous are amid bliss,
on couches, looking on.
 You   sg    can recognize     on their faces the radiance of bliss .
They are given to drink of a sealed nectar,
 whose end     is musk —and this is what competitors should compete for.
And its mixture is of Tasneem,
a spring from which those brought near drink.
Indeed, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who had attained faith;
and when they passed by them, they would wink at one another;
and when they went back to their families, they would go back jesting;
and when they saw them, they would say, “These people are most surely misguided.”
Yet they were not sent as preservers over them.
So today  those who have attained faith are laughing at the deniers,
on couches, looking on.
Have the deniers been recompensed for what they used to do?
