In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Bestower of mercy
All praise be to Allah, Lord of all realms,
the All-Merciful, the Bestower of mercy,
 Master of the Day of Recompense.
It is You we worship, and it is You we call for help.
Guide us to the straight path:
the path of those You have blessed, not those who have incurred (Your) wrath, nor those who have gone astray.
