O you enwrapped one,
stand up  during the night except a little–
for half of it or reduce it a little
or add to it, and chant the Recital  slowly and distinctly.
Indeed, We are about to cast upon you  sg   a heavy word.
The vigil of the night is indeed more  intense    and more upright for articulation.
Indeed, in the daytime you  sg   have lengthy work to do.
So remember the Name of your  sg   Lord and devote yourself to Him with (solemn)   devotion. 
 (He is)   the Lord    of the East and the West; there is no god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.
And endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely.
And leave to Me the disbelievers, those of luxury, and give them a brief respite.
Indeed, We have shackles and a purgatory
and food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day when the earth and the mountains tremble and the mountains became  heaps of sand.
Indeed, We have sent to you  pl   a messenger as a witness over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.
But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible seizing.
So how, if you  pl   deny, will you guard yourselves from a day which turns children gray-haired?
The heaven shatters thereby; His promise has always been fulfilled.
Indeed, this is a reminding, so whoever wills, let him take a way to his Lord.
Indeed, your  sg   Lord knows that you stand up nearly two-thirds of the night, and (sometimes you stand up)   half of it     , and  (sometimes you stand up)   one-third of it, along with a faction of those with you. And Allah determines the night and the day. He has known that you  pl   will be unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So recite of the Recital  whatever is easy (for you)  . He knew that some of you will be ill, and others traveling through the land seeking a share of Allah’s grace, and others combating in the way of Allah, so read of it what is possible for you, and establish the prayer, and bring  the purifying charity  , and lend Allah a good loan. And whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; it will be better and greater in reward. And seek Allah’s forgiveness; indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
