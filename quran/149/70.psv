 An asker asked about a punishment sure to come
for the deniers, that none can repel—
from Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.
Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend on a day the duration of which is fifty thousand years.
So be sg patient with beautiful patience.
Indeed, they see it distant,
but We see it near—
on the day when the sky is like molten brass,
and the mountains are like tufted wool,
and no intimate (friend) asks his intimate (friend) —
though they are shown each other. The criminal wishes he could be redeemed from the punishment of that day by sacrificing his children
and his female companion and his brother
and his kinsfolk who shelter him
and everyone on earth, so it would then save him.
But no! It is a raging fire
 that strips away the scalps,
inviting the one who had retreated and turned away 
and accumulated (wealth) and hoarded.
Indeed, man was created fretful:
when touched by adversity he is impatient,
and when touched by good he is ungenerous;
except the prayerful pl 
who are constant at their prayers;
and those in whose wealth is a rightfully acknowledged share
for the asker and the deprived;
and those who believe in the Day of Recompense;
and those who fear their Lord’s punishment—
indeed, none can feel secure from their Lord’s punishment;
and those who preserve their private parts ,
except from their spouses or those whom they rightfully possess—for then they are indeed not blameworthy.
But whoever seeks to go beyond that, then those are the transgressors;
and those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant;
and those who stand by their testimonies ;
and those who preserve their prayers—
those are honored in Gardens (of Paradise) .
So what is with those who have denied, craning their necks towards you sg ,
from the right and from the left, banding together?
Does every one of them ardently hope to be entered into a Garden of Bliss?
But no! Indeed, We created them from what they know.
So I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are surely able
to replace them with better than them, and We cannot be outstripped.
So let sg them blunder and play until they meet their day which they are promised—
the day when they come out of the tombs in a rush, as though they are hurrying towards some statues ,
their sight (s) (subdued) in reverence, humiliation overwhelming them. That is the day which they were promised.
