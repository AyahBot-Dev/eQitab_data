Tâ Sîn Mīm.
Those are the signs of the Evident Scripture.
Perhaps you  sg   are going to destroy yourself with sorrow because they do not believe?
If We will, We can  bestow    upon them a sign from heaven, at which their necks would stay bent in humility.
But no fresh reminder comes to them from the All-Merciful but they disregard it.
Thus they have certainly disbelieved, but soon will come to them the tidings of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not seen the land— how many noble kinds of plants We have germinated therein?
Indeed, in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And indeed, it is your  sg   Lord who is surely the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
And recall when Your Lord called to Moses, “Go to the unjust people—
the people of Pharaoh. Will they never be mindful?”
He said, “My Lord, I fear that they will disbelieve me.
 And my chest tightens    and my tongue  is not fluent , so send for Aaron (too)  .
And they hold (a charge of)  a misdeed against me, so I fear they will kill me.”
He said, “By no means! So go  dl   , with Our signs; We are with you  pl   , listening.
So go  dl   to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are indeed the Messenger of the Lord of all realms:
send the Children of Israel with us.’”
He said, “Did we not raise you  sg   among us as a child, and you stayed among us for many years of your life?
And you  sg   committed that base deed of yours that you committed while you were one of the deniers  .”
He said, “I did it then while I was one of those astray.
And I fled from you  pl   when I feared you, then my Lord gave me wise judgment and made me one of the emissaries.
And is that a favor you  sg   remind me of: that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?”
Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of all realms?”
He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you  pl    (can ever)  believe with certitude.”
He said to those around him, “Are you listening?”
He said, “Your  pl   Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers.”
He said, “This messenger of yours who has been sent to you is certainly a madman.”
He said, “The Lord of the east and the west and whatever is between them, if you  pl   can (ever)  reason.”
He said, “If you  sg   accept any god other than me, I will surely make you of the imprisoned.”
He said, “What if I bring you  sg   something evident?”
He said, “Bring it, if you  sg   are of the truthful.”
So he cast his staff and thereupon it was an evident serpent.
And he pulled his hand and thereupon it was white for the beholders.
He said to the chiefs around him, “This is indeed a knowledgeable sorcerer
who wants to evict you from your land with his sorcery, so what do you command?”
They said, “Put him off, and his brother, and send summoners to the cities
to bring you  sg   every knowledgeable magician.”
So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointment on a specified day.
And people were told, “Are you going to assemble,
that we may follow the sorcerers if they are the overcomers?”
So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us if we are the overcomers?”
He said, “Yes, and you will then most surely become of those brought near (to me)  .”
Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you intend to cast.”
So they cast their ropes and their staffs and said, “By Pharaoh’s might, we are most surely the overcomers.”
Then Moses threw his staff, and thereupon it swallowed what they had fabricated.
So the sorcerers fell down prostrating.
They said, “We have attained faith in the Lord of all realms,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
He said, “Have you  pl   believed in him before I have given you permission? He must be your leader who taught you sorcery. Well, you will certainly know soon; I will most surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will most surely crucify you all.”
They said, “No problem; indeed, to our Lord we are returning.
We ardently hope our Lord will forgive us our offenses, as we were the first of the believers.”
And We revealed to Moses: “Journey withMy servants by night; you  pl   will indeed be followed.”
So Pharaoh sent summoners to the cities.
“Indeed, these are just a small gang,
and they certainly do enrage us.
But indeed, we are  cautious    .”
So We got them out from gardens and springs
and treasures and a noble domicile.
So it was. And We made the Children of Israel inherit them.
And they pursued them at sunrise. 
And when the two groups sighted each other, the followers of Moses said, “We are indeed overtaken!”
He said, “By no means! My Lord is indeed with me; He will guide me.”
So We revealed to Moses: “Strike the sea with your staff,” whereupon it split, so that each part was like a great hill.
And thereupon, we brought the others near.
Then We saved Moses and those with him, all of them.
Then We drowned the others.
Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
And relate to them the tiding of Abraham,
when he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship?”
They said, “We worship human-shaped idols and we remain consecrating ourselves to them.”
He said, “Can they hear you  pl   when you call?
Or can they benefit you, or can they do harm?”
They said, “Rather, we found our forefathers doing so.”
He said, “Have you seen what you have been worshiping,
you and your ancient fathers?
They are enemies to me, except for the Lord of all realms,
Who created me and therefore He guides me;
and Who feeds me and gives me to drink;
and when I get sick, He heals me;
and Who makes me die and then revives me;
and Whom I ardently hope will forgive me my offense on the Day of Recompense.”
“My Lord, grant me wise judgment and include me with the righteous,
and make me a reputation of truth among later generations,
and make me of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss,
and forgive my father—he was indeed one of those astray,
and do not disgrace me on the day they are resurrected:
the day when neither wealth nor children are of help—
except for one who has come  to Allah witha sound heart.”
And the Garden (of Paradise)  was brought near for those who had been mindful,
while purgatory was displayed to the deluded ones.
And they were told, “Where is what you used to worship
apart from Allah? Can they support you or get support for themselves?”
Then they were toppled into it, together with the deluded ones
and the troops of Iblis  , all of them.
They said, as they disputed about it,
 “(We swear)  by Allah, we were surely in evident misguidance
for equating you  pl   with the Lord of all realms.
But no one misguided us except the criminals.
And now we neither have intercessors
nor any intimate friend.
So if only we could have another chance, we would be of the believers.”
Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
The people of Noah disbelieved the emissaries
when their brother Noah said to them, “Will you never be mindful?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is only from the Lord of all realms.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.”
They said, “Shall we believe in you , when  (only)   the lowliest have followed you    ?”
He said, “What do I know about what they used to do?
Their reckoning rests only with my Lord, if only you were aware.
And in no way would I expel the believers;
I am only an evident warner.”
They said, “If you do not refrain, O Noah, you will most surely be of those stoned.”
He said, “My Lord, my people have disbelieved me.
So legislate between me and them decisively, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers.
So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
Then We drowned the rest.
Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
ʻĀd  disbelieved the emissaries
when their brother Hûd said to them, “Will you never be mindful?
Indeed, I am to you  pl   a trustworthy messenger.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is only from the Lord of all realms.
Do you build a sign on every height for vanity’s sake?
And you set up fortresses, hoping to live eternally?
And when you  pl   strike, you strike mercilessly?
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And be mindful of the One Who supplied you with whatever you know.
He supplied you with livestock and children
and gardens and springs.
Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great day.”
They said, “It is equal to us, whether you admonish or be not of those who admonish.
This is nothing but the  character    of the ancients,
and we will never be punished.”
So they disbelieved him; thus We annihilated them. Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, Your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
Thamûd  disbelieved the emissaries
when their brother Salih said to them, “Will you never be mindful?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is only from the Lord of all realms.
Will you (always)  be left secure in whatever is here?
In gardens and springs
and vegetation (s)  , and palm-trees with tender yield?
And you carve houses in the mountains, with  skill    ?
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And do not obey the command of the extremists:
those who spread corruption in the land and do not reform.”
They said, “You are surely one of the bewitched;
you are nothing but a human being like us, so bring us a sign if you are of the truthful.”
He said, “This is a she-camel; she has her turn to drink, and you have your turn to drink on a well-known day.
And do not touch her with any harm, lest the punishment of a great day seize you.”
But they hamstrung her, then became remorseful  .
So the punishment seized them. Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
The people of Lot disbelieved the emissaries
when their brother Lot said to them, “Will you never be mindful?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is only from the Lord of all realms.
Of all the creatures in all realms, do you  pl   approach males?
And you leave what your Lord has created for you of spouses? Rather, you are a people who have transgressed.”
They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you will most surely be of those evicted.”
He said, “I am certainly one of those who abhor your practice.”
“My Lord, deliver me and my family from what they practice.”
So We delivered him and his family, all of them,
except for an old woman among those who lingered behind.
Then We destroyed the others.
And We rained down upon them a rain, so how bad was the rain of those forewarned!
Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
The Fellows of the Thicket disbelieved the emissaries
when Shu’aib said to them, “Will you never be mindful?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So be mindful of Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is only from the Lord of all realms.
Give full measure and do not be of the cheaters,
and weigh with accurate scales
and do not defraud people of their belongings, and do not go wickedly about the land, corrupting it.
And be mindful of the One Who created you  pl   and the masses of old.”
They said, “You are surely one of the bewitched.
And you are nothing but a human being like us, and we think that you are surely of the liars.
So make  pieces    from heaven fall on us, if you are of the truthful.”
He said, “My Lord knows better what you do.”
But they disbelieved him, so the punishment of the Day of Gloom seized them; it was indeed the punishment of a great day.
Most surely in that is a sign, and in no way were most of them believers.
And most surely, your  sg   Lord is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
And most surely, it is a bestowal from on high from the Lord of all realms.
The Trustworthy Spirit came down with it    
upon your  sg   heart, that you may be of the forewarners,
in an evident Arabic tongue.
And it is in the books of the ancients.
Is it not a sign for them that the scholars of the Children of Israel recognized it?
And had We bestowed it from on high upon some non-Arabs
and he had recited it to them, they would still not have believed in it.
Thus We inserted it into the hearts of the criminals.
They will not believe in it until they witness the painful punishment
which will come to them suddenly while they are unaware.
Then they will say, “Will we be reprieved?”
So do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
So have you  sg   seen if We let them enjoy (life)  for (many)  years,
then there comes to them what they were promised,
of what avail to them will their past enjoyments be?
And never did We destroy a town but it had forewarners—
a reminding, and in no way have We been unjust.
And in no way have the devils been descending with it,
for it neither suits them nor is it in their power.
They are indeed barred from hearing (it)  .
So do not call upon any other god with Allah, lest you  sg   be of those punished.
And warn your  sg   close kinsfolk,
and lower your wing  for those of the believers who have followed you.
But if they disobey you, say, “I am indeed innocent of what you do.”
 And    place your trust in the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy,
Who sees you when you rise,
as well as your movement among those who prostrate;
indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Shall I inform you  pl   upon whom the devils keep descending?
They keep descending upon every sinful fabricator.
They give ear, and most of them are liars.
And as for the poets—the deluded ones follow them.
Have you  sg   not seen that they aimlessly roam in every valley?
And that they say what they do not do?
Except for those who attained faith and did righteous deeds and remembered Allah frequently and defended themselves after they had been dealt with unjustly. And those who have been unjust will know the place of return to which they are bound to return.
