Alif Lām Mīm.
Do people think that they will be left to say, “We believe” without being tested?
Yet certainly We have tested those before them; thus Allah will surely know the truthful and He will surely know the liars.
Or do those who do evil deeds think that they can outstrip Us? Terrible is their judgment!
Whoever expects the meeting with Allah—the appointed time of Allah is sure to come, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Thus whoever strives—he only strives to his own benefit; most surely, Allah is Self-Sufficient (without need for any of the creatures)  of all realms.
And as for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—We will certainly remit their evil deeds and We will certainly repay them according to the best of what they used to do.
And We have enjoined upon man kindness towards his parents. But if they urge you  to associate with Me something you  sg   have no knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is your  pl   return, and I will inform you of what you used to do.
Those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—We will surely enter them among the righteous.
And among mankind is one who says, “We have attained faith in Allah.” Yet when he is hurt on Allah’s account, he equates the people’s persecution with Allah’s punishment. And if help comes from your  sg   Lord, he will definitely say, “We were actually with you  pl   .” Does not Allah know better whatever is within the chests of (all creatures of)  all realms?
And Allah will surely know those who have attained faith, and He will surely know the hypocrites.
And those who denied said to those who had attained faith, “Follow our way and we will carry your offenses.” But never will they (willingly)  carry any of their offenses; they are indeed liars.
Yet, they will surely carry their own heavy burdens and other heavy burdens with their own heavy burdens, and they will surely be asked on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to fabricate.
And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and He stayed among them for a thousand years, less fifty seasons. Then the Flood took them, for they were unjust.
But We saved him together with the fellows of the Ark, and We made it a sign for (all people of)  all realms.
And Abraham—recall when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and be mindful of Him; that is better for you if you only knew.
Indeed, whatever you  pl   worship apart from Allah are nothing but idols, and you create fabrications. Those you worship apart from Allah possess no provision for you, so seek your provision with Allah and worship Him and thank Him; to Him  you are returned    .”
And if you  pl   disbelieve, other communities before you have also disbelieved. And there is no responsibility upon the messenger except evident proclamation.
Have  they     not seen how Allah starts creation and then restores it? This is indeed easy for Allah.
Say  sg   , “Journey throughout the earth and look how He started creation.” Then Allah will bring about the next existence; Allah is indeed All-Powerful over everything.”
He punishes whomever He wills and He grants mercy to whomever He wills, and to Him you  pl   are turned back.
And you  pl   can neither thwart (God)  on earth nor in heaven, and apart from Allah you have neither ally nor supporter.
And those who denied Allah’s signs and the meeting with Him—those have despaired of My  mercy, and for those is a painful punishment.
But there was no response from his people except that they said, “Kill him or burn him.” But Allah saved him from the fire; indeed, in that are signs for people who believe.
And he said, “You  pl   have chosen idols apart from Allah, as a bond of love for one another in the Earlier Life. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another, and your shelter is the Fire, and you will have no helpers.”
Then Lot believed in him and said, “I am emigrating to my Lord; He is indeed the Almighty, the All-Wise.”
And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and conferred upon his offspring the prophethood and the scripture, and brought him his reward in the Earlier (Life)  . And indeed, he is in the Hereafter among the righteous.
And Lot—recall when he said to his people, “ Indeed, you do approach    obscenity such as nobody in all communities has ever committed before you.
Can it be that you do approach men and cut off the way  and commit what is deplorable in your gatherings?” But there was no response from his people except that they said, “Bring upon us Allah’s punishment if you  sg   are of the truthful.”
He said, “My Lord, help me against the corruptive people.”
And when Our messengers came to  Abraham    with the glad tidings, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town; indeed, its people have been unjust.”
He said, “Yet Lot is in it.” They said, “We know better of who is in it;  we will most surely  deliver     him and his family, except for his wife; she has become one of those who linger behind.”
Then, when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled and distressed on their account. But they said, “Do not fear nor grieve; we will  deliver     you and your family, except for your wife; she has become one of those who linger behind.
Indeed,  We will send     down upon the people of this town a torment from heaven on account of having been defiantly disobedient.”
And We left behind something of it as an evident sign for people who reason.
And to Midian (We sent)  their brother Shuʻaib. So he said, “O my people, worship Allah and expect the Last Day, and do not go wickedly about the land, corrupting it.”
But they disbelieved him, so the Tremor overtook them and they became lifeless bodies in their home.
And ʻĀd  and Thamûd  as well, as it has become evident for you  pl   from their (ruined)  residences. And Satan adorned their deeds for them, barring them from the way, even though they could see.
And Qarun and Pharaoh and Hamān—Moses certainly went to them with clear proofs, but they went about arrogantly in the land, and in no way were they forerunners.
Each We seized by his misdeed: so of them are those upon whom We sent a sandstorm, and of them are those who were taken away by the Shout, and of them are those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them are those whom We drowned. For never would Allah do them any injustice, but to themselves they used to do injustice.
The likeness of those who take for themselves guardians apart from Allah is as the likeness of the spider that takes for itself a house, and surely the feeblest of houses is indeed the house of the spider, if they only knew.
Indeed, Allah knows whatever thing  they     call upon apart from Him, and He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
And such parables We set forth for mankind, but none grasps them except the learned.
Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth; indeed, in that is a sign for the believers.
Recite what is revealed to you  sg   of the Scripture and establish the prayer; indeed the prayer forbids obscenity and what is deplorable. And surely the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows what you  pl   do.
And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in the best manner, unless it be those of them who have done injustice, and say, “We believe in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we are Muslims  .”
Likewise, We sent down to you  sg   the Scripture. So those to whom We gave the Scripture believe in it, and some of these ones believe in it, but none repudiate Our signs except the deniers.
And you  sg   never used to read any Scripture before it, and you never used to write it down with your right hand; otherwise the advocates of falsehood would have doubted.
In fact, it is evident signs in the chests of those given knowledge, and none repudiate Our signs except the unjust ones.
And they said, “Why  are no signs    sent down to him from his Lord?” Say  sg   , “Surely the signs are only in the Providence of Allah, and surely I am only an evident warner.”
Does it not suffice them that We revealed to you  sg   the Scripture which is recited to them? Indeed, in that is mercy and a reminding for people who believe.
Say, “Allah suffices as witness between you and me; He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believed in falsehood and denied Allah—it is those who are the losers.”
And they urge you  sg   to hasten the punishment. And were it not for a stated term, the punishment would have come to them. But it will come upon them suddenly while they are unaware.
They urge you to hasten the punishment, and indeed, Hell is surely encompassing of the deniers.
On the day when the punishment envelops them from above them and from beneath their feet, and  He says    , “Taste what you used to do!
O My servants who have attained faith: My earth is vast, so worship Me alone.
Every single self is sure to taste death, then to Us  you   pl    are returned    .
And those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—We will  settle    them in the Garden (of Paradise)  in Chambers under which rivers flow, abiding therein; how good is the reward of the workers
who endured patiently and in their Lord they place their trust!”
How many a treading creature is there that does not carry its provision? Allah provides for it and for you  pl   , and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
And surely, if you were to ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?” They would say, “Allah.” So how can they be averted (from the truth)  ?
Allah expands provision for whomever He wills of His servants and He restrains for him; indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
And surely, if you  sg   were to ask them, “Who sent down from the sky water with which He revived the earth after it had died?” They would say, “Allah.” Say  sg   , “Praise be to Allah.” Rather, most of them do not reason.
This Earlier Life is nothing but a distraction and a game, and indeed the Home of the Hereafter is truly the perennial life, if they only knew.
So when they embark on ships they call upon Allah, devoting religion to Him. But once He has delivered them safely to land, they promptly associate others (with Him)  ,
so that they deny whatever We have brought them and  so that they enjoy    , for they will eventually know!
Have they not seen that We have established a safe sanctuary, while all around them people are being snatched away? Do they believe in falsehood and deny the blessings of Allah?
And who is more unjust than one who has fabricated lies and attributed them to Allah or disbelieved the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the deniers?
And those who strove for Us—We will surely guide them in Our ways, for Allah  is most surely with those who excel in doing good.
