Ha, Mîm.
The bestowal of the Scripture from on high is by Allah the Almighty, the All-Wise.
Indeed, in the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers.
And in your pl own creation, and in the treading creatures He scatters, are signs for people who believe with certitude.
And the alternation of night and day, and the provision Allah has sent down from the sky, with which He has revived the earth after its death, and the shifting of the winds are signs for people who reason.
Those are Allah’s signs which We read to you sg in truth. So in which discourse, after Allah and His signs, will they believe ?
Woe to every sinful liar
who hears Allah’s signs b being read to him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though he did not hear them. So give sg him glad tidings of a painful punishment.
And when he learns something of Our signs, he takes them in mockery; for those is a demeaning punishment.
Beyond them lies Hell, and what they have earned will not benefit them at all, nor will those whom they took as guardians apart from Allah, and for them is a great punishment.
This is guidance, but those who have denied their Lord’s signs—for them is a painful punishment of torment .
Allah is the One Who has subjected to you pl the sea, that ships may run in it by His Command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks.
And He has subjected to you pl whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth—all is from Him. Indeed, in that are signs for people who reflect.
Tell sg those who have attained faith to forgive those who do not expect the Days of Allah, that He may repay people for what they used to earn.
Whoever acts righteously does so to his own benefit, while whoever commits evil does so to his own detriment, then to your pl Lord you are returned .
And surely We had given the Children of Israel the Scripture and wise judgment and prophethood, and We provided them with good things and favored them above all communities
and gave them evident explanations regarding matters. Thus they differed not except after knowledge had come to them, thereby oppressing one another. Indeed, your sg Lord judges between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding whatever they used to differ over.
Then We set you sg upon a (path of) legislation regarding matters, so follow it and do not follow the whims of those who do not know.
Indeed, they will never avail you sg against Allah in any way, for indeed, the unjust are guardians of one another, while Allah is the Ultimate Guardian of the ones mindful (of Him) .
This provides insights for mankind, and guidance and mercy for people who believe with certitude.
Or do those who have perpetrated evil deeds assume that We will make them as equal to those who h ave attained faith and have done righteous deeds, whether in their life or their death? Miserable is their judgment!
And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, and so that every soul will be repaid for what it has earned, for they will not be dealt with unjustly.
Have you sg seen the one who has taken his own whim as his god, and Allah has misguided him despite his knowledge, and has sealed his hearing and his heart, and has placed a veil over his sight? Who will guide him after Allah? Will you not remind yourselves ?
And they said, “There is nothing but our Earlier Life; we die and we live, for nothing annihilates us except time.” But they have no knowledge of that; they are only guessing.
And when Our signs are recited to them, evident, their only argument is to say, “Bring back our forefathers, if you pl are truthful.”
Say sg , “Allah gives you life, then He makes you die, then He gathers you for the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt; but most of mankind does not know.”
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Thus on the day when the Hour takes place—on that day the advocates of falsehood lose.
And you sg see every community kneeling; every community is called to its Scripture: “Today you pl are being repaid for what you used to do:
here is Our Scripture speaking about you pl in truth. Surely, We have been transcribing what you pl have been doing.”
As for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds—their Lord enters them into His mercy; that is the evident triumph.
But as for those who have denied (it will be said to them) : “Were My signs not read to you pl , yet you acted arrogantly and were a criminal people?”
And when it is said, “Indeed, the promise of Allah is true”—while of the Hour there is no doubt —you pl say, “We do not know what the Hour is; we are only making a guess; we are not certain.”
And the evils of what they had done became evident to them , and they became surrounded by what they used to ridicule.
And it was said, “Today We forget you pl as you forgot the meeting of this day of yours. Thus your shelter is the Fire, and there are no helpers for you.
That is because you pl dealt with Allah’s signs with ridicule, and the Earlier Life deceived you.” So today they are not brought out of it, and they are not allowed to make amends.
So praise be to Allah—Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all realms.
And to Him belongs all supremacy in the heavens and the earth, for He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.
