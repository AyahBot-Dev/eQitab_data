Ha Mīm.
By the Evident Scripture,
indeed, We made it an Arabic Recital , that you pl may reason.
And indeed, it is with Us in the Source of Scriptures, all-high, all-wise.
So shall We ignore reminding you pl , for having been an extremist people?
And how many a prophet did We send to the ancients!
Yet not a prophet came to them but that they used to ridicule him.
Thus We annihilated people more powerful than them, and so the example of the ancients has passed away.
And were you sg to ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth?” They would say, “The Almighty, the All-Knowing created them.”
He Who made the earth a cradle for you pl and traced in it ways for you, that you may be guided.
And He Who sent down water from the sky in due proportion, whereby We revived a lifeless land; thus you pl are brought out .
And He Who created all pairs and provided you pl with ships and livestock on which you ride,
that you pl may mount their backs then remember the blessing of your Lord as you settle upon them and say, “Highly Exalted is the One Who has subjected this to us, and in no way could we have done it by ourselves,
and indeed to our Lord we are certainly returning.”
Yet they ascribed to Him a portion of His servants. Surely, man is indeed an evidently staunch denier.
Or has He chosen for Himself daughters from what He creates, and favored you pl with sons?
Yet when one of them is given glad tidings of what he ascribed to the All-Merciful, his face becomes dark as he suppresses his anguish,
 (thinking) “What! Someone brought up amid adornments and, in conflict, cannot be evident?” 
And they considered the angels, who are servants of the All-Merciful, to be females. Did they witness their creation? Their claim will be recorded and they will be asked.
And they said, “Had the All-Merciful willed, we would not have worshiped them.” But they have no knowledge of that; they are merely conjecturing.
Or have We brought them a scripture prior to this one , so that they are adhering to it?
Rather, they said, “Indeed, we found our forefathers on a course , and indeed we are being guided in their footsteps.”
Likewise, We sentno warner before you sg to any town but its affluent ones said, “Indeed, we found our forefathers on a course b , and indeed we are following in their footsteps.”
 He would say , “Even if I have come to you pl with better guidance than what you found your forefathers following?” They would say, “Indeed, we deny what you pl are sent with.”
Thus We took retribution on them, so look sg at what the outcome was for the disbelievers.
And recall when Abraham said to his father and his people, “I am innocent of what you worship
except for the One Who originated me, for He will guide me.”
And he made it an enduring word in his posterity, so that they may return.
Yet I let these and their forefathers enjoy (life) until the truth and an evident messenger came to them.
But when the truth came to them, they said, “This is sorcery, and indeed we are deniers of it.”
They also said, “If only this Recital had been sent down to any great man from the two towns .”
Is it they who allocate the mercy of your sg Lord? It is We who have allocated their livelihood in the Earlier Life. And We elevated some of them by degrees above others, that some of them may employ one another in service. But your Lord’s mercy is better than what they hoard.
Were it not that humanity would become a single (ungodly) community, We would have provided those who deny the All-Merciful with roofs of silver to their houses, and stairways (of silver) by which they ascend,
and doors (of silver) to their houses, and furnishings on which they recline,
and (golden) decorations. Yet all that is nothing but the enjoyment of the Earlier Life, whereas the Hereafter with your sg Lord is for the ones who are mindful (of God) .
And whoever shuns the remembrance of the All-Merciful, We assign for him a Satan who then becomes his comrade.
And indeed, they certainly bar them from the way, though they think they are guided.
Until, when he comes to Us, he says, “If only there were between me and you sg the distance of the two easts.” What a miserable comrade!
Yet never will it benefit you pl on that day, since you have committed injustices, that you are partners in the punishment.
Can you sg make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and one who has been in evident misguidance?
So We will either take you sg away, then surely wreak vengeance upon them,
or We will surely show you what We have promised them, for indeed We have absolute power over them.
So adhere sg to what has been revealed to you; indeed you are upon a straight path.
And indeed it is surely a message for you sg and for your people, and you pl will be asked.
And ask those of Our messengers We sent before you sg : “Did We appoint gods apart from the All-Merciful to be worshiped?”
And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, so He said, “Indeed, I am the messenger of the Lord of all realms.”
Yet, as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they promptly started laughing at them,
even though each sign We showed them was more supreme than its counterpart, and We took hold of them with the punishment, that possibly they would return.
And they said (to Moses) , “O sorcerer, pray to your Lord for us according to His covenant with you, and then we will surely be guided.”
But when We lifted the punishment from them, they promptly broke their promise.
And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, “O my people, do I not have the dominion over Egypt, and are these rivers not flowing beneath me? Do you not see?
Or am I not better than this one who is despicable and can barely express himself?
So, if only some bracelets of gold had been cast on him, or if angels had come with him in comradeship!”
Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him; indeed they were a defiantly disobedient people.
So when they displeased Us, We took vengeance on them and We drowned them all.
So We made them a precedent and an example for later people.
And when the son of Mary was set forth as an example, your sg people promptly clapped him 
and said, “Are our gods better, or he?” They cited him only for argument; in fact, they are a quarrelsome people.
He is but a servant whom We blessed, and We made him an example for the children of Israel.
And had We willed, We would have made from among you pl angels to be successors on earth.
And indeed he is a portent of the Hour, so never be pl skeptical about it and follow Me; this is a straight path.
And let not Satan bar you pl ; indeed, he is an evident enemy to you.
And when Jesus came with the evident proofs, he said, “I have come to you pl with wisdom, and to clarify for you some of what you differ over, so be mindful of Allah and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him; this is a straight path.”
But the parties differed among themselves, so woe to those who committed injustices from the punishment of a painful day.
Are they only waiting for the Hour to come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?
On that day, close friends will be enemies to one another, except for the ones who were mindful (of God) .
O My servants, no fear shall be upon you today, nor shall you grieve.
Those who believed in Our signs and were Muslims :
enter the Garden (of Paradise) , you and your spouses, filled up with joy.
They are served around with trays of gold and cups, and therein is whatever is desired by the selves and delights the eyes, and therein you pl abide.
And that is the Garden (of Paradise) you pl were made to inherit on account of what you used to do.
For you pl therein is abundant fruit from which you eat.
Indeed, the criminals abide in the punishment of Hell
which is never palliated for them, and in it they are devastated.
Yet in no way did We do them injustice, but it was they who were the unjust.
And they cried f , “O Malek , let your Lord finish us off.” He said, “You are staying.
We certainly came to you with the truth, but most of you pl are hateful of the truth.”
Or have they contrived to do something? So indeed, We too are contriving.
Or do they think that We cannot hear their secret and their private conversations? Yes indeed, Our messengers are by them, writing down.
Say sg , “If the All-Merciful had a child , I would be the first of (his) worshipers.”
Highly Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe.
So leave sg them to blunder and play until they meet their day which they are promised.
And it is He who in the heaven is God, and in the earth is God, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.
And supremely blessed be the One to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and Who alone has knowledge of the Hour, and to Whom you pl are returned .
And those they call upon apart from Him are incapable of intercession, except those who testify to the truth knowingly.
And surely if you asked them, “Who created them?” they would certainly say, “Allah.” So how can they be averted (from the truth) ?
And (God hears) his statement: “My Lord, indeed, these are people who do not believe.”
Then grant sg them amnesty and say, “Peace.” For they shall come to know .
