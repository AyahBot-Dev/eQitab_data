By the morning shine.
By the night as it settlesâ€”
your Lord has not abandoned you sg , nor has He despised (you) .
And indeed the Last is better for you sg than the First,
and your Lord will certainly give you so that you will be well pleased.
Did He not find you sg an orphan, so He sheltered (you) ;
and found you wandering, so He guided (you) ;
and found you in need, so He enriched (you) ?
So as for the orphan, do sg not subdue;
and as for the asker, do not rebuke;
and as for the blessing of your Lord, do talk about it.
