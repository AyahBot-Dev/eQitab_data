When the sky splits apart,
and when the planets are scattered,
and when the seas are made to burst,
and when the tombs are strewn around—
each self will know what it has put forth and what it has deferred.
O Man, what deceived you concerning your Noble Lord,
Who created you and formed you and  proportioned     you ?
In whatever shape He willed, He assembled you.
But no, rather  you   pl    disbelieve    in the Recompense,
while indeed, over you are preservers—
honorable scribes—
who know whatever you do.
Indeed, the virtuous are in bliss,
while indeed, the wicked are in purgatory;
they will roast in it on the Day of Recompense,
and in no way will they be absent from it.
But what can make you  sg   realize what the Day of Recompense is?
Again, what can make you  sg   realize what the Day of Recompense is?
 (They will be recompensed   on)   a day    when no self is able to avail another self in anything, and the command on that day belongs to Allah.
