Qāf. By the Glorious Recital . . . 
But they marveled that a forewarner had come to them from among them, so the deniers said, “How strange!
Can it be that when we have died and become dust . . . ? This is a far-fetched return.”
We have already known what the earth consumes of them, and with Us is a constantly preserving record .
But they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are in a state of confusion.
Have they not looked at the sky above them—how We constructed it and decoratedit and how it has no fractures?
And the earth—how We spread it out and set on it firm mountains and germinated therein all kinds of lovely plants,
an eye-opener and a reminder for every penitent servant?
And We brought down from the sky blessed water and germinated with it gardens and grain to harvest,
and the soaring palm trees with clustered dates—
provision for the servants. And We revived thereby a lifeless land; likewise is the emergence.
Before them the people of Noah disbelieved, and (so did) the fellows of Al-Russ and Thamûd
and ʻĀd and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot
and the fellows of the Thicket and the people of Tubbaʻ; they all disbelieved the messengers, so My threat came true.
Were We fatigued by the first creation? Rather, they are in doubt of a new creation.
And surely We created man and know what his (inner) self whispers to him, for We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.
As the two receptors receive (him) , one on the right and one on the left, constantly seated.
Not a word does he utter, but close to him is a watcher, constantly ready.
Then came the daze of death with the truth: “That is what you sg were trying to avoid.”
And the Trumpet was blown : “That is the Day of the Threat.”
And every soul came forward, accompanied by a driver and a witness .
“Indeed, you sg were oblivious to this, so We removed your veil and your sight today is (as sharp as) iron.”
And His comrade said, “This is what I have ready with me.”
“Cast dl into Hell, every stubborn relentless denier,
preventer of good, transgressor, doubter,
who has set up another deity with Allah. So cast dl him into the severe punishment.”
His comrade said, “Our Lord, I did not make him exceed all limits, but he was in extreme misguidance.”
He said, “Do not dispute in My presence, for I have warned you pl in advance. 
The decree from Me cannot be changed, and I am not a tyrant unto the servants.”
On the day when We say to Hell, “Are you full?” And it says, “Are there any more?”
And the Garden (of Paradise) was brought closer to those mindful (of God) , not far away.
This is what you pl are promised —for every constant preserver who often turns to God,
the one who inwardly feared the All-Merciful and came with a penitent heart.
“Enter pl it in peace; that is the Day of Eternity.”
Therein they have whatever they desire, and We have even more.
And how many generations before them who were more powerful than they did We destroy! And they explored the lands—was there any escape?
Indeed, in that is a reminder for whoever possesses a heart or cares to listen and witness.
And surely We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days , and never were We touched by any fatigue.
So endure sg what they say, and highly exalt your Lord with praise before the rising of the sun and before sunset.
And highly exalt sg Him with praise in the night and after prostrations.
And listen sg on the day when the caller calls from a nearby place.
The day when they hear the Shout in all truth; that is the Day of Emergence.
Indeed, We—We alone—give life and cause death, and to Us is the destiny.
The day the earth ruptures open from above them, letting them rush out; that is an easy exodus for Us.
We know better what they say, and you sg are not a compeller over them, so remind by the Recital whoever fears My warning.
