O you who have attained faith, fulfil your contracts. Livestock animals have been made lawful to you except whatever is recited to you, provided that you do not make game-hunting lawful while you are consecrating yourselves to pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah decrees whatever He wants.
O you who have attained faith, do not violate Allah’s rites, nor the inviolable month, nor the offerings, nor the garlanded, nor those heading for the Inviolable House seeking grace and good pleasure from their Lord. And when you have left the pilgrim sanctity, then hunt. And let not  the hatred     of any people incite you to transgress  because they barred    you from the Inviolable Mosque. And cooperate with one another in showing virtue and mindfulness (of God)  , and do not cooperate with one another in sin and hostility. And be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is stern in retribution.
Prohibited for you  pl   are carrion and blood and the flesh of swine, and what was dedicated to other than Allah, and the strangled and the beaten (to death)  and the toppled (to death)  and the gored (to death)  and the (partly)  eaten by a wild animal—except what you (are able to)  slaughter (before its death)  —and what was sacrificed on altars, and that you determine shares through divination. All that is grave disobedience. Today, those who have denied have despaired of your religion, so do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you and have completed My blessings upon you, and I have approved Islam as a religion for you. But whoever is compelled by starvation, with no intent to sin, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
They ask you  sg   what is made lawful for them. Say, “All good things have been made lawful for you  pl   , and such hunting creatures as you teach, training them as hounds.” You train them according to what Allah has taught you, so eat from what they have caught for you and pronounce Allah’s name over it, and be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is Swift in reckoning.
Today all good things have been made lawful for you  pl   and the food of the People of the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And (lawful are)  believing women whose chastity is guarded, and women from the people who were brought the Scripture before you whose chastity is guarded—provided you give them their rewards in wedlock, not in fornication nor as mistresses. For whoever denies faith, then surely his work has been nullified, and in the Hereafter he is one of the losers.
O you who have attained faith, when you rise for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads  and     (wash)   your feet to the ankles. But if you are in a state of major impurity  , then cleanse yourselves. But if you are ill or traveling or one of you returns from relieving himself or you have touched women (in intercourse)  and cannot find water, then seek clean soil and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not want to cause you discomfort; rather He wants to cleanse you and to complete His blessing upon you, that you may give thanks.
And remember Allah’s blessing upon you  pl   and His pledge which He pledged you with, when you said, “We have heard and obeyed.” And be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what lies within the chests.
O you who have attained faith, stand firmly for Allah (as)  just witnesses, and let not  the hatred     of any people provoke you to be unjust. Be just—that is nearer to mindfulness (of God)  . And be mindful of Allah; indeed, Allah is All-Aware of all that you do.
Allah has promised those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds: for them is forgiveness and a great reward.
And those who have denied and disbelieved in Our signs—those are the fellows of purgatory.
O you who have attained faith, recall Allah’s blessing upon you when some people advanced to extend their hands against you, so He restrained their hands from you. So be mindful of Allah. And in Allah let the believers place their trust.
And most surely Allah took the pledge of the Children of Israel, and We  delegated from among them twelve leaders. And Allah said, “I am indeed with you; if you establish the prayer and bring  the purifying charity  and believe in My messengers and rally to them and lend Allah a good loan, I will most surely remit your evil deeds and most surely enter you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of you denies afterwards, then he has certainly strayed from the right way.”
So on account of their violation of their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts  hard    , (for)  twisting the words out of their contexts, and they forgot some of what they were reminded of. And you  sg   will continue to view treachery on their part except for a few of them, so pardon them and overlook. Indeed, Allah loves those who excel in doing good.
And from those who have said, “We are Christians,” We took their pledge. But they forgot some of what they were reminded of, so We provoked enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection, when Allah  will inform them of what they used to do.
O People of the Scripture, Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying for you much of what you kept hidden of the Scripture and overlooking much. A light from Allah  d   has surely come to you, and an Evident Scripture
with which Allah guides whoever has followed— (for)  His good pleasure— (to)  the ways of peace, and brings them out of darkness (es)  into light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.
Most surely, those who said, “Allah is the Christ, son of Mary,” have denied (faith)  . Say  sg   , “So who could have prevented Allah, had He wanted to annihilate the Christ, son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth?” For to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates whatever He wills, for Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
Moreover, the Jews and the Christians said, “We are the children of Allah and are His beloved.” Say  sg   , “Why then does He punish you for your misdeeds?” Rather, you are but human beings from among those He created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills, for to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, and to Him is the destiny.
O People of the Scripture, Our Messenger has surely come to you, making things clear to you—after a cessation of sending messengers—so that you cannot say, “Neither a herald of glad tidings nor a warner has come to us.” In fact, a herald of glad tidings and a warner has come to you, for Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
And recall when Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He made among you prophets and made you kings and brought you what He never brought anyone (else)  in all communities.”
“O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has prescribed for you, and do not turn on your heels lest you return as losers.”
They said, “O Moses, there are certainly tyrannical people in it, and we will certainly not enter it until they depart it. So if they depart it, we will then surely enter.”
Two men of those who fear (God)  —on whom Allah had bestowed His blessings—said, “Enter upon them by the gate, for as soon as you have entered it, you are then indeed overcomers. And place your trust in Allah if you are believers.”
They said, “O Moses, we will certainly not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you and your Lord, and combat. We are surely staying behind right here.”
He said, “My Lord, I have control only over myself and my brother, so separate between us and the defiantly disobedient people.”
He said, “Then surely, it is forbidden for them for forty years as they wander through the land, so do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people.”
And read  sg   to them the true story of Adam’s two sons: when they offered an offering, so it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other. He said, “Most surely I will kill you.” He said, “Indeed, Allah accepts only from the ones who are mindful (of Him)  .
If you do stretch your hand towards me to kill me, never will I stretch my hand towards you to kill you; indeed, I fear Allah, Lord of all realms.
Indeed, I want you to bear my sin and your sin and thus become one of the fellows of the Fire, for such is the repayment for the unjust.”
Then His (inner)  self prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him and (thus)  became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground to show him how to cover his brother’s corpse. He said, “Woe to me! Was I incapable of being like this raven and burying my brother’s corpse?” And he became of the regretful.
Because of that We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a (human)  self—unless it is for (murder of)  another self or corruption in the land—it is as if he has killed mankind, all together. And whoever gives life to it, it is as if he has given life to mankind, all together. And most surely Our messengers came to them with evident proofs, but very truly after that, many of them are  extremists.
Indeed, the punishment for those who fight Allah and His Messenger and rush about in the land spreading corruption is that they be relentlessly killed or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides or be banished from the land. That is a disgrace for them in the Earlier (Life)  , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment—
except for those who have repented before you  pl   apprehend them. So know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
O you who have attained faith, be mindful of Allah and seek the means of approach to Him and strive in His way, that you may succeed.
As for those who have denied—even if they own whatever is in the earth, all of it, and the like of it with it to ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them, and for them is a painful punishment.
They want  to depart the Fire, but in no way are they to depart it, and for them is a perpetual punishment.
And the male thief and the female thief: cut  pl   their hands as a repayment for what they have earned—a deterrent from Allah, for Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
But whoever has repented after his injustice and has reformed, then indeed, Allah accepts his repentance. Indeed, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
Have you  sg   not come to know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills, for Allah is All-Powerful over everything.
O Messenger, do not be saddened by those who hasten towards denial from among those who said with their mouths, “We believe,” but whose hearts have not attained faith, and of the ones who have Judaized—they are constant listeners to lies; they are constant listeners to other people who have not come to you; they distort the words out of their context, saying, “If you  pl   are given this, then take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.” And whomever Allah wants to put to trial, you  sg   will be powerless against Allah on his behalf. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah did not want to cleanse. For them is disgrace in the Earlier (Life)  , and for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
They are constant listeners to lies; they are constant devourers of illicit earnings. So if they come to you  sg   , then judge between them or disregard them. And if you disregard them, then they will not harm you in any way. Yet if you judge, then judge between them justly. Indeed, Allah loves the just  pl   .
But how do they come to you  sg   for judgment when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s judgment? Yet they turn away after that. And in no way are those believers.
Indeed, We sent down the Torah, wherein is guidance and light by which the prophets who submitted  themselves (to God)  judged those who Judaized, and (so did)  the Godly   (scholars)  and the rabbis, as they were required to preserve Allah’s Scripture and were witnesses to it. So do  pl   not fear mankind, but fear Me. And do not purchase, in exchange for My signs, a small price. And whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down, then those  are the deniers.
And We prescribed for them therein:  that the life     is for the life, and  (that)   the eye is for the eye, and  (that)   the nose is for the nose, and  (that)   the ear is for the ear, and  (that)   the tooth is for the tooth, and  (that)   for wounds is fair retribution    . But whoever donates  it, then it is an atonement for him. And whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down, then those  are the unjust.
And in their  footsteps We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming what preceded him of the Torah. And We brought him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the Torah that preceded him, and a guidance and an admonition to the ones who are mindful (of God)  .
 So let     the people of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has sent down in it. And whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down, then those  are the defiantly disobedient.
And We sent down to you  sg   the Scripture with truth, confirming whatever scripture that preceded it and an overseer over it. So judge between them according to what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their whims instead of the truth that has come to you. For each of you  pl   We have assigned a legislation and a method. And had Allah willed, He could have made you a single community, but in order to test you through what He has brought you; so race towards good works. To Allah is your return, all of you, then He will inform you regarding whatever you used to differ over.
So judge  sg   between them according to what Allah has sent down, and do not follow their whims. And beware of them lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah wants to afflict them for some of their misdeeds. And most surely, many people are defiantly disobedient.
Is it the judgment of (the era of)  pagan ignorance that  they     desire ? And who is better than Allah in judgment for people of firm faith?
O you who have attained faith, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies; some of them are allies of one another. And whoever of you allies himself with them is indeed one of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the unjust people.
So you  sg   see those in whose hearts is sickness hastening towards them. They say, “We fear that the wheel of fate may turn against us.” But hopefully Allah will bring about the conquest or something else from Himself, whereupon they will regret what they concealed within themselves.
 And those    who have attained faith  say    , “Are these the ones who swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that they are very truly with you  pl   ?” Their deeds have been nullified, so they became losers.
O you who have attained faith, whoever of you turns back from his religion—then Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, humble  pl   towards the believers, mighty towards the deniers. They strive in the way of Allah and do not fear the blame of any blamer. That is Allah’s grace; He brings it to whomever He wills, for Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Indeed, your  pl   ultimate guardian is Allah and His Messenger and those who have attained faith—those who establish the prayer and bring  the purifying charity  while they bow down.
And whoever allies himself with Allah and His Messenger and those who have attained faith—then surely the party of Allah are the overcomers.
O you who have attained faith, do not take as allies those who take your religion for mockery and a game from among those who were given the Scripture before you  or the deniers    . And be mindful of Allah if you have (really)  attained faith.
And when you  pl   call to the prayer, they take it for mockery and a game. That is because they are people who do not reason.
Say  sg   , “O People of the Scripture, do you resent us only because we have attained faith in Allah and in what was sent down to us and in what was sent down previously, while most of you are defiantly disobedient?”
Say  sg   , “Shall I inform you of worse than that as requital from Allah? (It is the retribution of)  the one whom Allah has cursed and upon whom is His wrath, and (those)  whom  He made into apes and pigs, and the  worshipers of false masters    . Those are in a worse position and further astray from the right way.
And when they come to you  pl   , they say, ‘We have attained faith,’ though they have entered with denial, and they have departed with it. But Allah knows better what they have been concealing.”
And you  sg   see many of them hastening towards sin and hostility and their devouring of illicit gains. Truly miserable is what they have been making!
If only the Godly  scholars and the rabbis would forbid them from speaking sinfully and devouring illicit gains! Truly miserable is what they have been practicing!
And the Jews said, “Allah’s hand is shackled.” Shackled are their hands, and they were cursed for what they said! Rather, both His hands are outstretched; He spends as He wills. And most surely, what was sent down to you  sg   from your Lord will increase many of them in exceeding all limits and in denial. And We cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle a fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. And they rush about in the land spreading corruption, and Allah does not love corrupters.
And had the People of the Scripture attained faith and been mindful (of God)  , We would surely have remitted their evil deeds and entered them into the Gardens of Bliss.
And had they established the Torah and the Gospel and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet  . Among them is a moderate community, but (regarding)  many of them—evil is what they do.
O Messenger, proclaim what was sent down to you from your Lord; but if you do not, then you will not have proclaimed  His message    , for Allah safeguards you from mankind. Indeed, Allah does not guide the denying people.
Say  sg   , “O People of the Scripture, you have no basis until you establish the Torah and the Gospel and what was sent down to you from your Lord.” But most surely what was sent down to you  sg   from your Lord will increase many of them in exceeding all limits and in denial, so do not be sorry for the denying people.
Indeed, those who have attained faith and those who have Judaized and the Sabians and the Christians—whoever has attained faith in Allah and the Last Day and has acted righteously—then  no fear     shall be upon them  , nor shall they grieve.
We very truly took a pledge from the Children of Israel and We sent to them messengers; whenever a messenger came to them with what their (inner)  selves did not desire, one group they disbelieved, and another group they kill  .
And they thought that there would be no trial, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Allah granted them repentance and accepted it from them; then (again)  many of them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is All-Seeing of whatever they do.
Most surely, those who said, “Allah is the Christ, son of Mary,” have denied (faith),  for the Messiah (himself)  said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord; indeed, whoever associates (others)  with Allah, then surely for him Allah has forbidden the Garden (of Paradise)  , and his shelter is the Fire. And for the unjust there are no supporters.”
Most surely, those who said, “Indeed, Allah is the third of three,” have denied (faith)  , for there is no god except one God. And if they do not refrain from what they say, a painful punishment will very truly befall those of them who have denied.
Will they not repent to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
The Messiah, son of Mary, is no more than a messenger before whom other messengers had passed away, and his mother was an unwavering believer; they both used to eat food. Look how We make the signs evident for them, then look how they are (still)  averted (from the truth)  .
Say  sg   , “Do you worship apart from Allah what possesses for you neither harm nor benefit, while Allah is the One Who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing?”
Say  sg   , “O People of the Scripture, do not exaggerate in your religion beyond the truth, and do not follow the whims of people who have already gone astray before and have led many astray and have (themselves)  strayed off the right way.”
Cursed were those who denied from among the Children of Israel by the very tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That is because they disobeyed and used to transgress.
They used not to forbid one another from any deplorable thing they did. Truly miserable is what they have been doing!
You  sg   see many of them taking those who deny as allies. Truly miserable is what their (inner)  selves have put forth for them, that Allah’s anger fell upon them and in the punishment they abide.
And had they believed in Allah and the Prophet and in what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as allies. But many of them are defiantly disobedient.
You  sg   will definitely find that the most severe of mankind in enmity towards those who have attained faith are the Jews and those who have associated (others with God)  , and you will find that the nearest of them in (genuine)  love towards those who have attained faith are those who said, “We are indeed Christians.” That is because among them are priests and monks, and because they never act arrogantly.
And when they hear what was sent down to the Messenger, you  sg   see their eyes overflowing with tears for what they recognize of the truth; they say, “Our Lord, we have attained faith, so write us down with those who bear witness.
And how should we not believe in Allah and what has come to us of the truth, andwe ardently hope that our Lord will enter us along with the righteous people (into Paradise)  ?”
So Allah rewarded them for what they said—Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; and that is the repayment of those who excel in doing good.
But those who denied and disbelieved in Our signs—those are the fellows of purgatory.
O you who have attained faith, do not prohibit the good things Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress; indeed, Allah does not love the transgressors.
And eat of the lawful, good things Allah has provided for you, and be mindful of Allah in whom you are believers.
Allah does not hold you  pl   accountable for idle talk involving your oaths  , but He holds you accountable for your  firm binding of oaths    ; so its atonement is by feeding ten destitute people from the best of what you feed your families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave  . But if anyone does not find (the means)  , then fasting for three days. That is the atonement for (breaking)  your oaths when you have sworn them. So keep  your oaths. Allah thus clarifies His signs for you, that you may give thanks.
O you who have attained faith, surely intoxicants and gambling and idolatry and divination are an abomination of Satan’s work, so avoid it, that you may be successful.
Indeed, Satan only wants to induce enmity and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to bar you from the Reminder of Allah and from the prayer; so will you desist?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and be cautious, for if you  pl   turn away, then know that the only duty of Our   Messenger is evident proclamation.
No sin is committed by those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds regarding what they may have eaten, provided they become mindful (of God)  and attain faith and do righteous deeds, then maintain being mindful (of God)  and being faithful, then remain mindful (of God)  and excel in doing good, for Allah loves those who excel in doing good.
O you who have attained faith, Allah will most surely test you with something of the game that your hands and spears reach, that Allah may know who fears Him, though unseen; so whoever transgresses after that—then forhim is a painful punishment.
O you who have attained faith, do not kill game while you are consecrating yourselves to pilgrimage. And whoever of you kills any intentionally, then  a penalty:     the like of what he has killed of domestic animals, as determined by two reliable persons from among you—an offering delivered to the Kaʻbah  —or  an atonement: food    for (some)  destitute people or by fasting an equivalent number of days, so that he may taste the grievous consequences of his conduct. Allah has pardoned what has passed, but whoever reverts, then Allah will take vengeance on him, for Allah is Almighty, Capable of vengeance.
The game of the sea and its food have been made lawful for you  pl   as an enjoyment for you and for travelers, while the game of the land has been forbidden for you as long as you are consecrating yourselves to pilgrimage. And be mindful of Allah to whom you are herded.
Allah has appointed the Kaʻbah—the Inviolable House—a leverage for mankind, as well as every inviolable month and the offerings and the garlanded; all this so that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that Allah is All-Knowing of everything.
Know  pl   that Allah is Stern in retribution, and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
The Messenger’s only responsibility is proclamation, while Allah knows what you disclose and what you conceal.
Say  sg   , “The nasty and the good are not equal, even though the multitude of the nasty may impress you  sg   . So be mindful of Allah, O you people of understanding, that you may succeed.”
O you who have attained faith, do not ask about things that would trouble you if disclosed to you. But if you  pl   ask about them while the Recital  is being  bestowed from on high    , they will be disclosed to you; Allah has pardoned that, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Clement.
Surely, some people before you asked (about)  them, then of them they became deniers.
Never did Allah institute (the superstitions of)  : the ear-slit she-camel or the free-grazing she-camel or the successive female-bearing cattle or the protected ten-sire camel. But those who denied fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not reason.
Thus when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers upon.” What if their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided?
O you who have attained faith, you are responsible for your (inner)  selves; he who has strayed cannot harm you if you are guided. To Allah is your return, all of you, so He may inform you of what you used to do.
O you who have attained faith, when death approaches one of you, let two reliable persons from among you act as witnesses to the making of the bequest, or two persons from another people if you are traveling in the land and the calamity of death afflicts you. Summon  pl   them after the prayer so that they swear by Allah—if you have doubts— (saying)  : “We will not purchase, in exchange for it  , any price, even if it were a relative, and we never conceal Allah’s testimony; we would then most surely be of the sinners.”
So if it is discovered that both of them are guilty (of perjury)  , then two others deserve to take their place from among those  responsible     for the claim —the two most concerned—and have them swear by Allah, “Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and we have not transgressed; we would then most surely be of the unjust.”
That makes it more likely that they give the right testimony, or else have fear that their oaths might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. So be mindful of Allah and listen. For Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.
On the day when Allah gathers the messengers, then says, “What response were you given?” They said  , “We have no knowledge; indeed, it is You Who are the Superb Knower of the hidden realms.”
When Allah said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, recall My blessing upon you and upon your mother when I aided you with the holy spirit, (making)  you speak to people while in the cradle and in the prime of manhood; and when I taught you the Scripture and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you create  from clay the shape of  birds    , by My leave, then breathe into it so it becomes  birds    , by My leave; and when you heal the born-blind and the leper, by My leave; and when you bring out the dead, by My leave; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you brought them the evident proofs. But those who denied among them said, `This is nothing but evident  sorcery    .’”
And recall when I revealed to the disciples: “Believe in Me and in My Messenger.” They said, “We have attained faith, so bear witness that We are certainly Muslims  .”
And recall when the disciples said, “O Jesus, son of Mary,  can     your Lord  bestow upon us from on high    a table spread (with food)  from heaven?” He said, “Be mindful of Allah, if you are believers.”
They said, “We want to eat from it, and so that our hearts are serene, and to know that you have told us the truth, and to be of its witnesses.”
Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Allah, our Lord, send down for us a table spread (with food)  from heaven to be a feast for us, for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from You. And provide for us, for You are the Best of providers.”
Allah said, “Indeed, I shall  bestow     it upon you  pl    from on high ,but whoever of you denies thereafter, then I shall indeed punish him with a punishment the like of which I never punish anyone of (My creation in)  all realms.”
And recall when Allah said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind, ‘Take me and my mother as two gods apart from Allah?’” He said, “Highly Exalted are You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know whatever is within my (inner)  self, and I do not know whatever is within Your Self. You are indeed the Superb Knower of the hidden realms.
Never did I tell them except what You commanded me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them, but when You took me up, You became the Watcher over them, and You are Witness over everything.
If You punish them, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.”
Allah said, “ This is the day    when the truthful benefit from their truthfulness.” For them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah became well pleased with them, and they became well pleased with Him. That is the great triumph.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever lies in them, and He is All-Powerful over everything.
