By those unleashed in succession ,
and by those storming turbulently .
By those scattering far and wide,
and by those separating decisively,
and by those casting a Reminder ,
excusing or warning––
indeed, what you pl are promised is sure to come.
So when the stars are obliterated,
and when the sky is fractured,
and when the mountains are blown away,
and when the messengers are gathered to their appointed time––
to which day is it deferred?
To the Day of Decision.
And what can make you sg realize what the Day of Decision is?
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
Did We not destroy the ancients,
then follow them up with the later ones?
This is how We deal with the criminals.
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
Did We not create you pl from a despicable fluid,
then lodged it in a secure place
for a known term?
And We have determined, so what excellent determiners are We!
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
Did We not make the earth a homestead
for the living and the dead,
and set on it lofty, firm mountains, and gave you pure water to drink?
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
“Proceed to what you pl used to disbelieve in. 
 Proceed to a shadow that rises in three different columns,
offering no shade and unavailing against the flames .” 
It shoots sparks like huge buildings,
as if they are yellow camels .
Woe on that day to the disbelievers
This is a day when they do not speak,
nor are they allowed to apologize.
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
This is the Day of Decision; We have gathered you pl , together with the ancients.
So if you have a plot, then plot against Me.
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
Indeed, the mindful (of God) are amidst shades and springs
and fruits as they desire.
“Eat and drink pleasantly on account of what you pl used to do.”
Indeed, this is how We repay those who excel in doing good.
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
“Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you pl are indeed criminals.”
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
And when it is said to them, “Bow down”, they do not bow down.
Woe on that day to the disbelievers.
So in what discourse, beyond this, will they believe?
