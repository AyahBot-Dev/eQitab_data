By the spreaders spreading  ,
and by those bearers of loads,
and by those moving gently,
and by those distributing as commanded—
what you  pl   are promised is true.
And, indeed, the Recompense is sure to come.
By the heaven comprising interwoven tracks,
indeed, you  pl   are of different opinions  .
Averted from it is he who is averted.
May the conjecturers perish!  
Those who are unmindful and in perplexity,
asking, “When is the Day of Recompense?”
The day they are heated on the Fire:
“Taste your trial; this is what you  pl   , (challengingly)  have been asking to be hastened.”
Indeed, the mindful (of God)  are amidst Gardens (of Paradise)  and springs,
taking what their Lord has given them. Indeed, before that, they used to excel in doing good:
they used to lie down but little of the night,
and at dawn they would seek forgiveness,
and in their wealth was a share for the asker and the deprived.
And on earth are signs for those who believe with certitude,
and within yourselves; do you not see?
And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised.
So by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, indeed, it is as true as the fact that you  pl    (can)  pronounce.
Has the story of  Abraham’s    honored guests reached you  sg   ?
When they entered upon him they said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”
And he slipped away to his family and brought a fatted calf
and set it before them. He said, “Will you not eat?”
And he was filled with apprehension towards them. They said, “Do not be afraid,” and they announced to him the glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.
So his wife came forward with a shriek, then clasped her face and said, “A barren old woman!”
They said, “Thus your Lord has said; He is the All-Wise, the All- Knowing.”
He said, “So what is your business, O emissaries?”
They said, “We have been sent to a criminal people,
to unleash upon them rocks of clay,
marked by your  sg   Lord for the extremists.”
Then We brought out all the believers who were in it.
Yet We found in it only one household of Muslims,
and We left in it a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.
And in Moses (there is also a sign)  —when We sent him to Pharaoh with an evident manifestation.
But he turned away with his warlords and said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”
So We seized him and his troops and flung them into the waters, and he was to blame.
And (likewise)  in (the people of)  ʻĀd  —We sent against them the Barren Wind,
sparing nothing it came upon without rendering it like decayed ruins.
And (likewise)  in (the people of)  Thamûd  —they were told, “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”
But they defied the command of their Lord, so the  Lightning struck  them as they looked on,
and they could not rise up, nor could they help themselves.
And (recall)   before that, the people    of Noah—indeed, they were a defiantly disobedient people.
And the universe—We constructed it with power, and We are surely expanding it.
And the earth—We spread it out. So how excellent are We who prepared it!
And We created all things in pairs, that you may  remind     yourselves .
“So flee to Allah; I am to you  pl   from Him an evident warner.
And do not set up any other god with Allah; I am to you from Him an evident warner.”
Likewise, no messenger came to those before them but they said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”
Did they recommend it to one another? In fact, they are a people who exceed all limits.
So turn away from them, for you  sg   are not to blame.
And remind, for the reminder benefits the believers.
And I did not create the unseen beings  and humans but to worship Me.
I need no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me.
Allah is the All-Providing, the Possessor of power, the All-Firm.
So, indeed, those who do injustice will have their lot like the lot of their fellows, so let them not hasten Me.
So woe to those who have denied from that day of theirs which they are promised.
