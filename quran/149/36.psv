Ya-Sîn.
By the all-wise Recital  .
You  sg   are indeed of the emissaries
on a straight path.
 (God bestowed it as)   a bestowal    from on high by the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy,
to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are oblivious.
Certainly, most of them deserved the decree on them, for they refuse to believe.
Indeed, We placed shackles around their necks up to their chins, so that their heads are forced up.
And We placed a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and thus We blocked their vision so they cannot see.
And it is the same for them whether you  sg   warn them or do not warn them—they believe not.
Indeed, you  sg   can only warn one who has followed the Reminder and has feared the All-Merciful though unseen—so give him glad tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward.
Indeed, We—We alone—revive the dead and write down what they have put forth and their traces. And everything have We tallied in an evident archive.
And set  sg   forth for them the parable of the fellows of the town when the Emissaries came to it—
when We sent them two persons but they disbelieved them, so  We reinforced     (them)  with a third. Then they said, “Truly, We are emissaries sent to you.”
They said, “You are nothing but human beings like us, and the All-Merciful did not send down anything; you are only lying.”
They said, “Our Lord knows that we are indeed emissaries sent to you,
and our only duty is evident proclamation.”
They said, “We see an evil omen in you  pl   ; if you do not give up, we will most surely stone you, and a painful punishment from us will most surely afflict you.”
They said, “Your evil omen is within yourselves.  Can it be that it is because you were  reminded    ? Rather, you are an extremist people!”
And there came a man rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O my people, follow the emissaries.
Follow those who do not ask you  pl   any reward, and are themselves guided.
And why should I not worship the One Who originated me, and to Whom  you   pl    are returned    ?
Shall I take other gods apart from Him? If the All-Merciful wants harm for me, their intercession does not avail me at all, nor can they rescue me.
In that case, I should indeed be in evident misguidance.
Indeed, I have attained faith in your  pl   Lord, so listen to me.”
It was said, “Enter the Garden (of Paradise)  .” He said, “Oh if only my people could know
how my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of the honored!”
And after him, We sent down no soldiers from heaven to his people, nor would We ever send any down.
 It was just    a single Shout, and suddenly they were extinct.
Alas for the servants! No messenger comes to them but they ridicule him.
Have they not seen how many generations We annihilated before them—that they will not return to them?
And  none of them     but will be arraigned before Us, all together .
And there is a sign for them in the lifeless land: We have revived it and have brought out from it grains, so from it they eat.
And We have made in it gardens of palm-trees and grapevines, and have caused springs to burst forth in it,
that they may eat from its produce and (from)  what   their hands have made    . So will they not give thanks?
Highly Exalted is He Who created all pairs—of what the earth germinates and of their own selves  and of what they do not know.
And a sign for them is the night: We strip the day out of it—and they are suddenly in darkness.
And the sun runs towards its destination; such is the determining of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
 And We have determined the moon    in phases until it returned like an old palm-branch.
The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is the night to outpace the day, and each floats in an orbit.
And a sign for them is that We carried  their offspring    in the laden ship,
and We created for them the like of it in which they ride.
And if We will, We can drown them—with no screaming to be heard from them, nor will they be rescued,
except by a mercy from Us and enjoyment for a while.
And when it is said to them, “Be mindful of what lies before you and what lies behind you, that you may receive mercy” . . .  
Yet never does a sign of their Lord’s signs come to them, but they disregard it.
And when it is said to them, “Spend of what Allah has provided for you,” those who deny say to those who have attained faith, “Shall we feed someone whom Allah could feed, if He so wills? You are but in evident misguidance.”
And they say, “When will this promise be, if you  pl   are truthful?”
All they can expect is a single Shout, which will take them away while they feud,
so that they will neither be able to make a will nor return to their own people.
And the trumpet was blown  , whereupon they walked quickly out from the tombs to their Lord.
They said, “Woe to us! Who has resurrected us from our resting place?” This is what the All-Merciful has promised, and the emissaries have spoken the truth.”
 It was just    a single Shout, and suddenly they were all arraigned before Us.
So today no soul is dealt with unjustly in the least, and you  pl   are not repaid except for what you used to do.
Indeed, today the fellows of the Garden (of Paradise)  are happily busy,
they and their spouses,  in shades    , reclining on couches.
For them are fruits therein, and for them is whatever they call for.
“Peace”—a word from a Lord Bestowing of mercy.
But step aside today, you criminals.
Did I not covenant with you, O Children of Adam, that you shall not worship the devil—indeed, for you he is an evident enemy—
and that you shall worship Me? This is a straight path.
Yet he has certainly led a great multitude of you astray. Did you not use reason?
This is Hell which you  pl   were promised.
Roast in it today on account of how you used to deny.
Today, We put a seal upon their mouths, and their hands speak to Us, and their feet testify to whatever they used to earn.
And if We will, We can obliterate their eyes, then they race with each other to (find)  the Path—but how will they see?
And if We will, We can disfigure them right in  their place    , so that they can neither move forward nor go back.
And to whomever We give long life, We reverse his development—so will  they     not reason ?
And never did We teach him  poetry, nor is it proper for him; it is but a Reminder and an Evident Recital  —
 so that it may forewarn    whoever is alive, and so that God’s decree may be deserved by the deniers.
Have they not seen that We have created for them, of Our Handiwork, livestock, so that they are their owners?
And We made them manageable by them, so some they ride and some they eat.
And they have in them other benefits and drinks, so will they not give thanks?
Yet they have taken to themselves gods other than Allah, that perhaps they may be supported.
They cannot support them, even if they are arraigned for them as an army.
So let not their words sadden you  sg   . Indeed, We know whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public.
Has man not regarded that We created him from a sperm-drop? Yet he became an evident adversary,
and he set forth a parable for Us and forgot his own creation. He said, “Who can revive the bones when they have decayed?”
Say  sg   , “He who initiated them the first time revives them, for He is All-Knowing of every creation.”
He who made fire for you  pl   out of green trees, so that with them you kindle.
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth  capable     of creating the like of them? Yes indeed, and He is the All-Creating, the All-Knowing.
Indeed, His only command once He has desired anything is to say to it,  “Be,” and so it is    .
So Highly Exalted is the One in Whose hand is the dominion of everything, and to Him  you   sg    are returned    .
