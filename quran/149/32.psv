Alif Lām Mīm.
The bestowal of the Scripture from on high is—no doubt about it—by the Lord of all realms.
Yet they say, “He has fabricated it.” Rather, it is the truth from your sg Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be guided.
Allah is the One Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days , and then settled over the Throne; apart from Him, you pl have neither ally nor intercessor. Will you not remind yourselves?
He governs every matter from the heavens to the earth, then it ascends to Him on a day the length of which is a thousand years by your pl count.
That is the Knower of the hidden realm and the manifest, the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy
Who has made excellent everything He created , and He originated the creation of man from clay,
then made his progeny from an extract of a despicable fluid,
then He proportioned him and breathed into him of His Spirit, and He gave you pl hearing and sight (s) and burning hearts; little do you give thanks.
And they said, “ Can it be that when we have becomelost into the earth— can it be that we will reallybe brought to a new creation?” Rather, they do deny the meeting with their Lord.
Say sg , “The angel of death put in charge of you pl takes you, then to your Lord you are returned .”
And if only you sg could see the criminals bowing their heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we have seen and we have heard, so send us back, that we may act righteously; we are (now) certain.”
And had We willed, We could have brought every soul its guidance, but the declaration from Me will come true: “I will most surely fill Hell with (the race of) unseen beings and human beings, both together.”
So taste, on account of how you pl forgot the meeting of this day of yours; indeed, We have forgotten you, so taste the eternal punishment on account of what you used to do.
The only people who (truly) believe in Our signs are those who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrating and highly exalt their Lord with praise, and they are not arrogant.
Their sides shun the beds as they pray to their Lord out of fear and ardent hope, and from Our provisions to them they spend.
No soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort to the eyes—a repayment on account of what they used to do.
So, is the one who has been a believer like the one who has been defiantly disobedient? They are not equal.
As for those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter—hospitality on account of what they used to do.
But as for those who have defiantly disobeyed, their shelter is the Fire; every time they want to depart it, they are brought back into it, and it is said to them, “Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.”
And We will certainly make them taste the lesser punishment (in this life) prior to the greater punishment, that they may return.
And who is more unjust than one who was reminded of his Lord’s signs, then disregarded them? We will certainly wreak vengeance upon the criminals.
And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do sg not regard his meeting with scepticism. And We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel.
And of them We appointed leaders guiding by Our command, when they persevered patiently and were certain of Our signs.
Indeed, your sg Lord is the One Who judges between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding whatever they used to differ over.
Is it not a guidance for them: how many generations We caused to perish before them, amidst whose residences they (now) walk? Surely in that are signs. Do they not hear?
Have they not seen that We conduct the water to a dry land, and with it We bring out vegetation from which their livestock eat, and they themselves? Do they not see?
And they say, “When is this conquest, if you pl are truthful?”
Say sg , “On the Day of Conquest the belief of the ones who had denied will not benefit them, and they will not be given respite.”
So disregard sg them and wait. Indeed, they (too) are waiting.
