Ha Mīm.
By the Evident Scripture,
We have indeed sent it down on a blessed night  . Indeed, We have always been warning.
Onit, every wise command is distinguished—
a command from Us; indeed, We have always been sending
mercy from your  sg   Lord—indeed, it is He who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing—
 (from the)   Lord    of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you  pl    (can ever)  believe with certitude.
There is no god but He; He gives life and causes death—your  pl   Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers.
Yet they play around in doubt.
So wait  sg   and watch out for the day when the sky produces evident smoke
that overwhelms mankind; this is a painful punishment.
“Our Lord, lift the punishment from us; we are truly believers.”
But how can the reminding benefit them when an evident messenger had already come to them,
then they turned away from him and said, “ (He is)  taught (by others)  , a madman!”
Indeed, if We lift off the punishment a little, you  pl   will revert.
On the day when We assault with the biggest onslaught, We will indeed wreak vengeance upon them.
And surely before them We tested the people of Pharaoh when a noble messenger  came to them,
saying, “Hand over Allah’s servants to me; indeed, I am to you  pl   a trustworthy messenger.
And do not consider yourselves to be above Allah; indeed, I come to you with an evident manifestation.
And I have indeed sought refuge with my Lord and your  pl   Lord lest you stone me.
Thus if you  pl   do not believe in me, just keep away from me.”
Then he called upon his Lord—that these people are criminals.
 (Then His Lord commanded,)  “Journey with My servants by night; indeed, you  pl   will be followed.
And leave  sg   the sea parted (behind you)  ; indeed, they are an army to be drowned.”
How many gardens and springs did they leave behind,
as well as vegetation (s)  and a noble domicile
and a blessing they used to enjoy?
So it was. And We made another people inherit it.
So neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor were they reprieved.
And surely, We delivered the Children of Israel from the demeaning punishment—
from Pharaoh; indeed, he was of the extremists.
And We chose them knowingly over all communities,
and gave them of the signs that which was an evident test.
Indeed, these people surely say,
“There is nothing but our first death, for we will not be resurrected.
So bring  pl   back our forefathers, if you are truthful!”
Are they better, or the people of Tubbaʻ  and those before them? We annihilated them; indeed, they were criminals.
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them to play.
We did not create them except with truth, but most of them do not know.
Indeed, the Day of Decision is the appointed time for them all—
a day when no patron will avail a protégé in any way, and they cannot be supported,
except for one upon whom Allah has had  mercy; indeed, He is the Almighty, the Bestower of mercy.
Indeed, the Tree of Zaqqum  
 is the food of the sinful one, 
 like molten brass boiling    in the bellies
like the boiling of scalding water.
“Take  pl   him and drag him into the midst of Hell,
then pour over his head some of the punishment of scalding water!”
 “Taste   sg    ! You    —indeed you—are the mighty, the noble  .
Indeed, this is what you  pl   were  skeptical about.”
Indeed, the mindful (of God)  are in a safe domicile,
amidst Gardens and springs,
dressed in silk and brocade, facing one another.
So it is. And We married  a   them to spouses with lovely wide eyes.
They call therein for every kind of fruit, feeling safe.
Therein they do not taste death beyond the first death, and He  shielded them from the punishment of Hell—
a grace from your  sg   Lord; that is the great triumph.
Thus have We made it  easy through your  sg   tongue, that they may remind themselves.
So wait and watch  sg   . Indeed, they too are waiting and watching.
