Tâ Sîn. Those are the signs of the Recital and an Evident Scripture—
guidance and glad tidings for the believers
who establish the prayer and bring the purifying charity and, of the Hereafter, they are certain.
Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter—We have adorned their deeds for them, so they wander aimlessly;
those are the ones for whom is the worst punishment, and in the Hereafter they are the biggest losers.
And indeed, you sg are surely receiving the Recital b from One who is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
Recall when Moses said to his family, “I have surely glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news from it, or bring you a firebrand, a borrowed flame , that you may warm yourselves.”
Then when he reached it, he was called: “Blessed is whoever is in the fire and whoever is around it, and Highly Exalted is Allah, Lord of all realms.
O Moses, it is indeed I, Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise.
Now, cast your staff.” So when he saw it shaking as though it were a snake, he turned away, fleeing, and did not look back. “O Moses, fear not! Truly, in My presence emissaries have nothing to fear,
except for one who did an injustice then substituted kindness for evil—then I am surely Oft-Forgiving, Bestowing of mercy.
And put your hand inside the opening of your garment (and) it will come out white, without any evil affliction—among nine signs to Pharaoh and his people; they have indeed been a defiantly disobedient people.”
So when Our signs came to them as an eye-opener, they said, “This is evident sorcery.”
And they repudiated them, though their (inner) selves were certain of them—out of injustice and haughtiness; so look sg what the outcome was for the corrupters.
And indeed, We brought David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, “Praise be to Allah, Who has favored us over many of His believing servants.”
And Solomon succeeded David, and he said, “O mankind, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given of everything; this is most surely the evident grace.”
And to the service of Solomon were herded his troops of unseen beings and men and birds, all held in strict order,
until, when they came upon the valley of ants, an ant said, “O you ants! Enter into your homes, lest Solomon and his troops crush you while they are unaware.”
So he smiled, laughing at her speech, and said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for Your blessings which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do righteousness that well pleases You. And include me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants.”
Then he inspected the birds and said, “What is it with me? Can I not see the hoopoe, or is he among the absentees?
Most surely, I will either punish him severely or slay him, unless he brings me an evident excuse.”
But he did not stay away for long and he said, “I have encompassed that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with sure tidings.
I found a woman reigning over them, and she has been given of everything, and she has a great throne.
I found her and her people prostrating to the sun apart from Allah, for Satan has adorned their deeds for them and has thus barred them from the way, so that they are not guided — 
 that they do not prostrate themselves to Allah, Who brings out what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows whatever you hide and whatever you make public.
Allah—there is no god but He, Lord of the Great Throne.”
He said, “We will see whether you have spoken the truth or have been one of the liars.
Go with this letter of mine and cast it to them, then turn away from them and wait to see what they say to each other.”
She said, “O chiefs, a noble letter has indeed been cast down to me;
it is indeed from Solomon, and it is indeed, ‘In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Bestower of mercy:
You must not exalt yourselves above me and must come to me as Muslims .’”
She said, “O chiefs, give me your opinion in this matter of mine. I never take a decision on any matter except in your presence.”
They said, “We are a people of power and of intense force, and you are in command, so see what you wish to command.”
She said, “Indeed, when kings enter a town, they corrupt it and humiliate its dignified people, and this is what they (always) do.
Thus I am sending them a gift and will see what the emissaries return with.”
So when he came to Solomon, he said, “Are you pl supplying me with wealth? What Allah has brought me is better than what He has brought you. Rather, it is you who rejoice when given gifts.
Return sg back to them. Indeed, we will come upon them with troops they cannot resist, and indeed, we will evict them from it, humiliated and dishonored.”
He said, “O chiefs, which one of you can bring me her throne before they come to me as Muslims ?”
A powerful one of the unseen beings said, “I will bring it to you sg before you rise from your seat, and indeed, I am certainly strong and trustworthy enough to do it.”
The one who had knowledge of the Scripture said, “I will bring it to you before you blink your eye.” So when he saw it settled before him, he said, “This is of my Lord’s grace, to test me: whether I will thank or will deny. For whoever is thankful is only thankful to his own benefit, and whoever has denied —my Lord is, indeed, Self-Sufficient, Noble.”
He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and we shall see whether she will be guided or be one of those who are never guided.”
So when she arrived, it was said, “Is your throne like this?” She said, “As if this is it.” (Solomon said,) “And We were given knowledge before her and we have always been Muslims a .”
But she was barred by whatever she used to worship apart from Allah; indeed, she was of a denying people.
She was told, “Enter the tower.” And when she saw it, she thought it was a deep pond and she bared her legs. He said, “It is a tower paved with glass.” She said, “My Lord, I have indeed been unjust to myself, and I have submitted with Solomon to Allah, Lord of all realms.”
And indeed, We sent to Thamûd their brother Saleh (saying) , “Worship Allah.” But they promptly became two disputing groups.
He said, “O my people, why do you ask that the bad be hastened before the good? If only you would ask Allah’s forgiveness so that you may be shown mercy.”
They said, “We consider you sg a bad omen, and those with you (too) .” He said, “Your omen is with Allah. In fact, you are a people being tried.”
And there were nine persons in the city who were spreading corruption in the land and would not reform.
They said, “Swear by Allah to one another that we will surely attack him and his family at night, and then we will emphatically tell his kinsman seeking retribution, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are indeed truthful.’”
And they schemed a scheme, and We schemed a scheme while they were unaware.
So look sg at how the outcome of their scheming was that We did destroy them and their people, all of them.
So here are their houses, vacant, on account of their injustice. Indeed, in this is surely a sign for people who know.
And We saved those who believed and were mindful (of God) .
And Lot (too) , when he said to his people, “Do you commit obscenity while you can see (its shamefulness) ?
Do you approach men with lust instead of women? Rather you are an ignorant people.”
But the only response of his people was to say, “Evict Lot’s folk from your town; indeed, they are a few people who always keep themselves clean.”
So We saved him and his family, except for his wife, whom We destined to be of those who lingered behind.
And We rained upon them a rain, and so evil was the rain of the forewarned.
Say sg , “Praise be to Allah and peace be upon His servants whom He has elected. Is Allah better or what they associate ?”
Or who (else then) is the one who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down to you pl from the sky water with which We germinated gardens full of beauty, whose trees you could not have germinated? Is there any other god with Allah? Rather, they are a people who equate .
Or who (else then) is the one who made the earth habitable and made rivers flow through it and set firm mountains for it and placed a partition between the two seas? Is there any other god with Allah? Rather, most of them do not know.
Or who (else then) is the one who responds to someone in need when he calls upon Him and relieves evil and makes you successors on earth? Is there any other god with Allah? Little do you remind yourselves .
Or who (else then) is the one who guides you pl through the darkness (es) of the land and the sea, and who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings before His mercy? Is there any other god with Allah? Most High is Allah above what they associate.
Or who (else then) is the one who originates creation and then restores it, and Who provides for you pl from the sky and the land? Is there any other god with Allah? Say sg , “Produce your pl proof, if you are truthful.”
Say sg , “No one in the heavens or the earth knows what is hidden except Allah.” For they are unaware of when they will be resurrected;
rather, their knowledge has been reached in the Hereafter; rather, they are in doubt about it; rather, they are completely blind to it.
And those who denied said, “ Can it be that when we have become dust, and our forefathers— can it be that we will really be brought out?
Most surely, we were promised this before, we and our forefathers; this is nothing but the legends of the ancients.”
Say sg , “Journey through the earth and look what the outcome was for the criminals.”
But do sg not grieve over them and do not be troubled by what they scheme.
And they say, “When is this promise, if you are truthful?”
Say sg , “Perhaps some of what you are asking to be hastened has drawn near.”
And indeed, your sg Lord is surely the Possessor of grace towards mankind, but most of them are not thankful.
And indeed, your sg Lord knows whatever their chests harbor and whatever they make public.
And never is there anything hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in an evident record .
This Recital indeed narrates to the Children of Israel most of what they differ over,
and most surely it is a guidance and a mercy to the believers.
Indeed, your sg Lord decrees between them by His wise judgment, and He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
So place your sg trust in Allah; you are indeed upon the evident truth.
Indeed, you sg cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call if they withdraw and turn their backs.
Nor can you sg guide the blind out of their utter misguidance; you can make no one hear except those who believe in Our signs, and are (thus) Muslims .
And when the decree is fulfilled against them, We will bring out for them—from the earth—a treading creature that will tell them that mankind used to have no certitude in Our signs.
On the day when We herd from every community a crowd of those who disbelieve our signs, so that they are held in strict order.
Until, when they come (before their Lord) , He will say, “Did you deny My signs and did you not encompass them in knowledge, or what were you doing?”
And the decree shall be fulfilled against them for the injustices they did, and they shall be speechless.
Have they not seen that We have made the night for them to rest therein and the day allowing sight? Indeed, in that are signs for people who believe.
And on the day when the Trumpet is blown, and everyone in the heavens and the earth was horrified, except whomever Allah willed, and everyone came before Him in humility.
And you sg see the mountains, thinking them fixed, yet they pass as the passing of the clouds—the making of Allah Who has perfected everything; He is indeed All-Aware of what you do .
Whoever comes with a good deed—for him is one better than it and they are safe from horror on that day,
while whoever comes with an evil deed—their faces are tumbled into the Fire. “Are you being repaid except for what you used to do?”
 (Say sg ) “Indeed, I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this township, Who has made it inviolable and to Whom everything belongs, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims 
and to read the Recital ; so whoever is guided, then he is surely guided to his own benefit. And whoever goes astray, then say, “Indeed, I am only one of the forewarners.”
And say sg , “Praise be to Allah; He will show you pl His signs and you will recognize them. For in no way is your sg Lord oblivious of what you pl do .”
