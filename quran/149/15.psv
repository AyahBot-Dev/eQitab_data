Alif Lām Ra. Those are the signs  of the Scripture and an evident Recital  .
Perhaps those who have denied will wish they had been Muslims.
Let  sg   them eat and enjoy and be distracted by (false)  hope, for they willcome to know.
For in no way did We annihilate any town except that it had a known written decree.
No community can advance its time, nor can they delay it.
And they said, “O you upon whom the Reminder has been bestowed from on high, very truly you are insane.
If only you would bring us the angels, if you are one of the truthful!”
 We bestow     not the angels from on high except with the truth  , and in no way would they  then be respited.
Indeed, We—We alone—have bestowed the Reminder from on high, and We will most surely preserve it.
And most surely We sent (messengers)  before you  sg   to the sects of the ancients,
but no messenger comes  to them but they used to ridicule him.
Thus We insert it  into the hearts of the criminals—
they do not believe in it, though the rule of (God regarding)  the ancients has surely passed before.
And if We were to open for them a gateway into the sky so that they were to continue ascending through it,
they would surely say, “Indeed, our sight (s)  have been  stupefied    ; rather, we are a people bewitched.”
And most surely, We have made constellations in the sky and adorned it to the beholders;
and We have preserved it from every outcast devil,
except the one who eavesdrops and is followed by an evident meteor.
And the land—We spread it and cast firm mountains in it, and We germinated therein of everything in proper measure.
And We made livelihoods for you  pl   in it, as well as for those for whom you are not the providers.
For there is not a thing but with Us are its treasuries, yet in no way do We bestow it from on high except in a known measure.
And We sent the  winds    , fertilizing, then sent down water from the sky and gave it to you  pl   to drink, and in no way are you its keepers.
And indeed, We—surely, We—give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritors.
And most surely We have known those of you who passed away, and most surely We have known those who come afterwards;
and indeed, it is your  sg   Lord Who herds them  together; indeed, He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.
And most surely We created man from potter’s clay, of fermented mud,
while We created the unseen being  before from the fire of the searing wind.
And recall when your  sg   Lord said to the angels, “I am creating a human being from potter’s clay, of fermented mud.
So when I have formed him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down to him, prostrating.”
So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together—
but not Iblis  . He refused to be with those who prostrated themselves.
He said, “O Iblis  e   , what keeps you from being with those who prostrate themselves?”
He said, “Never would I prostrate myself to a human being whom You created from potter’s clay, of fermented mud.”
He said, “Then get out of it  , for indeed you are an outcast,
and indeed the curse is upon you until the Day of Recompense.”
He said, “My Lord, then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected.”
He said, “Then, you are indeed of the ones reprieved
until the Day of the Time Appointed.”
He said, “My Lord, since You have deluded me, I will most surely adorn for them (evil deeds)  on earth, and I will most surely delude them all,
except for Your  sincere chosen    servants among them.”
He said, “This is a straight path  which is binding on Me    :
over My servants you  sg   have no authority indeed, except for those who follow you of the deluded ones.
And indeed, Hell is the meeting place for them all.
It has seven gates; for each gate is an assigned class.”
Indeed, the mindful (of God)  are amid Gardens and springs.
“Enter it in peace, feeling safe.”
And We removed  whatever malice was within their chests—as brethren, on couches facing each other.
No fatigue touches  them therein, nor from it will they ever be brought out.
Inform  sg   My servants that I—only I—am the Oft-Forgiving, the Bestower of mercy,
and that My punishment is the painful punishment.
And inform them of the guests of Abraham,
when they entered upon him and said, “Peace.” He said, “We are truly scared of you.”
They said, “Do not be scared; we bring you  sg   glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy.”
He said, “Have you brought me glad tidings when old age has touched me? So what glad tidings could  you give    ?”
They said, “We brought you true glad tidings, so be not of the despairing ones.”
He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s mercy except for those  astray?”
He said, “So what is your business, O emissaries?”
They said, “We have been sent to a people of criminals,
except for Lot’s folk; we will most surely  deliver    them all,
except for his wife.” We have determined that she will most surely be of those who linger behind.
So when the emissaries came to Lot’s folk,
he said, “You are an unknown people.”
They said, “Rather, we have come to you  sg   with that about which they were skeptical,
and we have brought you the truth, and very truly we are truthful.
So journey with your family at the latter part of the night and follow at their rear, and let none of you turn around, and proceed  pl   wherever you  pl   are commanded.”
And We decreed to him that matter: that the last trace of these would be uprooted by the morning.
And the people of the town came anticipating glad tidings.
He said, “Indeed, these are my guests, so do not embarrass me,
and be mindful of Allah and do not disgrace me.”
They said, “Did we not forbid you  sg   from (receiving)  any people  ?”
He said, “These are my daughters, if you must.”
By your  sg   life, in their drunkenness they certainly do blunder!
So the Shout took them away at sunrise.
And We turned it upside down and rained down upon them stones of hard clay.
Indeed, in that are certainly signs for those who contemplate.
And indeed, it  is certainly on an existing way.
Indeed, in that is certainly a sign for the believers.
And indeed, the fellows of the Thicket were certainly unjust,
so We took retribution on them, and indeed, both are certainly in an evident archive.
And most surely, the fellows of Al-Hijr  disbelievedthe emissaries.
So We brought them Our signs, but they used to disregard them.
And of the mountains they used to carve homes, feeling safe.
But the Shout took them away by the morning,
so all what they used to earn was of no avail to them.
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them except with the truth  . And indeed, the Hour is coming, so pardon  sg    (with)  gracious pardoning.
Indeed, your  sg   Lord is the One Who is the All-Creating, the All-Knowing.
And most surely, We have brought you  sg   seven of the oft-repeated  and the great Recital  .
Do  sg   not look longingly at the good things We have given some classes of them to enjoy, and do not grieve over them  , and lower your wing  towards the believers.
And say, “Indeed, it is I—I who am the evident warner.”
So too did We send down to those who divide among themselves—
those who have made the Recital  f   into fragments.
So by your  sg   Lord, We will surely ask them all
about what they used to do.
So proclaim  sg   openly what you are commanded and disregard the polytheists.
Indeed, We have sufficed you  sg   against the mockers:
those who set up another god with Allah. So they will come to know.
And most surely We are aware that your  sg   chest tightens with what they say.
So exalt your Lord with praise and be of those who prostrate,
and worship your Lord until Certitude  comes to you.
