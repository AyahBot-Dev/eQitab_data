Indeed, We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment.”
He said, “O my people, indeed, I am an evident warner to you:
that you should worship Allah and be mindful of Him, and obey me.
He will then forgive you pl your misdeeds and reprieve you until (you fulfill) a stated term; indeed, Allah’s term cannot be deferred once it has come, if you only knew.”
He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and day,
but my call has only made them flee the more.
And indeed, every time I called them, that You may forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears and wrapped themselves in their garments and insisted and became extremely arrogant.
Then I called them openly,
then I spoke to them publicly and I spoke to them privately,
and I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness–indeed, He has always been Forgiving.
He will send (rain from) the sky upon you pl in showers
and supply you with wealth and children and allot for you Gardens (of Paradise) and allot for you rivers.
What is the matter with you pl that you do not expect (a reward for having) reverence towards Allah
although He created you in stages?
Have you pl not seen how Allah has created seven heavens in layers?
And He has made the moon therein a light, and He has made the sun a lamp.
And Allah has germinated you pl from the (dust of the) land,
then He will return you into it and will bring you out again.
And Allah has made the land a spread for you pl ,
that you may travel its pathways made broad.’”
Noah said, “My Lord, indeed, they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth and children increased him in nothing but in loss.
And they schemed outrageous schemes,
saying, ‘Do not abandon your pl gods, and do not abandon Wadd, nor Souwaʻ, nor Yaghooth and Yaʻooq and Nasra .
And truly, they have misguided many, so do not increase the unjust except in misguidance.”
For their offenses, they were drowned then hurled into a fire, and they did not find any supporters apart from Allah.
And Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave of the deniers a single dweller in the land.
Indeed, if You leave them, they will misguide your servants and beget none but wicked relentless deniers.
My Lord, forgive me and my parents and anyone who enters my house as a believer, and all the believing men and believing women, and do not increase the unjust except in perdition.”
