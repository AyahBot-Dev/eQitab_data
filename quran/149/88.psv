Has there come to you sg the news of the Overwhelming (event) ?
Some faces on that day are (subdued) in reverence,
toiling, exhausted,
 roasting in a hot fire,
given to drink from a boiling spring.
They have no food except of a thorny bush
which neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger.
Some faces on that day are blissful,
well pleased with their endeavor,
in a lofty Garden:
 in it you hear no nonsense ;
in it is a flowing spring;
in it are raised couches,
and cups set in place,
and cushions set in rows,
and carpets spread around.
Do they not look at the camels—how they were created?
And at the sky—how it was raised?
And at the mountains—how they were firmly fixed?
And at the earth—how it was spread out?
So remind; you sg are only a reminder;
you have no control over them.
But whoever turns away and denies,
then Allah punishes him with the greatest punishment.
Indeed, to Us is their return,
then upon Us is their reckoning.
