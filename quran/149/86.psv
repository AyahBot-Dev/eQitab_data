By the sky and the pulsar.
But what can make you sg realize what the pulsar is?
The Drilling Star.
 There is no self but has a preserver over it.
Let man look at what he was created from.
He was created from an ejected fluid,
coming out from between the backbone and the breastbones.
He is certainly able to return him
on the day when the secrets are put on trial,
then he will have neither strength nor helper.
By the sky that returns .
By the earth that cracks openâ€”
it is most surely a decisive word ,
and it is no joke.
Indeed, they are plotting plots,
but I plot plots (as well) .
So give sg the deniers respite; respite them briefly.
