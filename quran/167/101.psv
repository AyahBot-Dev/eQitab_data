The Striking Event!
What is the Striking Event?
And what may let you know what the Striking Event is?
(It will happen) on a day when people will be like scattered moths,
and the mountains will be like carded wool.
Then, the one whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy
will be in a happy life.
But he whose scales are light,
his abode will be Abyss.
And what may let you know what that (Abyss) is?
A blazing fire!
