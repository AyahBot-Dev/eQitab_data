When the sky will be cleft asunder,
and when the stars will disperse,
and when the seas will be burst forth,
and when the graves will be overturned,
then one will know what he sent ahead and what he left behind.
0 man! What has deceived you about your Gracious Lord,
who created you, then perfected you, then brought you in due proportion?
He composed you in whichever form He willed.
Never! (i.e. one should never be heedless towards him.) But you deny the Requital,
while (appointed) over you there are watchers,
who are noble, writers (of the deeds),
] who know whatever you do.
Surely the righteous will be in bliss,
and surely the sinners will be in Hell,
in which they will enter on the Day of Requital,
and they will not (be able to) keep away from it.
And what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?
Again, what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?
A Day when no one will have power to do anything for another! And all matters, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone).
