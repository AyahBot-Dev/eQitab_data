O you, enveloped in a mantle,
stand up and warn,
and pronounce the greatness of your Lord,
and purify your clothes,

and do no favour (to anyone merely) to ask more (in exchange),
and for the sake of your Lord, observe patience.
For when the trumpet is blown,
that day will be a difficult day,
not easy for the disbelievers.
Leave me (to deal) with the one whom I have created lonely,
and I gave him extensive wealth,
and sons present before (his) eyes,
and extended (power and honour) to him fairly well.
Still, he aspires that I should give him more.
Never! He is inimical towards Our verses.
I will force him to climb (the mountain) sa'ud.
He pondered and suggested.
Death onto him! How (bad) is the suggestion he has put forward!
Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the suggestion he has put forward!
Then he looked (to those around him,)
then he frowned and scowled,
then turned his back, and waxed proud,
then said, "This is nothing but traditional magic;
this is nothing but saying of a mortal."
will put him into Saqar (Hell).
And what can let you know what Saqar is?
It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor leaves (any disbeliever outside).
It will disfigure the skins.
Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens).
And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from among) angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who disbelieve, so that those who are given the Book may come to believe, and those who believe may increase in belief, and so that those who are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the disbelievers say, "What has Allah meant by this (sentence that is as strange as a) proverb?" Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind.
Truly, I swear by the moon,
and by the night when it goes back,
and by the morning when it becomes bright,
it (saqar: Hell) is one of the greatest things
as a warning to the mankind
] to the one who wishes to come forward (towards good deeds) or to go back (from them).
Everyone will be detained (in the Hell) because of what he did,
except the People of the Right, (i.e. those who will be given their Book of Deeds in their right hands)
who will be in gardens, asking
about the guilty persons,
"What has brought you to? (Saqar: Hell) "
They will say, "We were not among those who offered salah, (obligatory prayer)
and we used not to give food to the needy,
and we used to indulge (in mocking at the truth) along with those who indulged,
and used to deny the Day of Requital,
until when we were overtaken by that which is certain."
Then intercession of intercessors will not avail them.
So what has happened to them that they are turning away from the Reminder,
as if they were wild donkeys,
fleeing from a lion?
Rather, every one of them wishes that he should be given unrolled (divine) scriptures.
Never! But they do not fear the Hereafter.
Never! Indeed, this is a Reminder.
So, whoever so wishes may take advice from it.
And they will not take advice unless Allah so wills. He is worthy to be feared, and worthy to forgive.
