Pronounce the purity of the name of your Most Exalted Lord,
who created (everything), then made (it) well,
and who determined a measure (for everything), then guided (it),
and who brought forth pasturage,
then turned it into blackening stubble.
We will make you recite, then you will not forget
except that which Allah wills. Indeed He knows what is manifest and what is hidden.
And We will facilitate for you (to reach) the easiest way.
So, extend advice (to people) if advice is useful.
The one who fears (Allah) will take to the advice,
and it will be avoided by the most wretched
who will enter the Biggest Fire,
then he will neither die therein, nor live (a life worth mentioning).
Success is surely achieved by him who purifies himself,
and pronounces the name of his Lord, then offers prayer.
But you prefer the worldly life,
while the Hereafter is much better and much more durable.
Indeed this is (written) in the earlier divine scripts,
the scripts of Ibrahim and Musa.
