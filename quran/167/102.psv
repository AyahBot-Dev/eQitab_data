You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing (worldly benefits),
until you reach the graves.
No! (This is not a correct attitude.) You will soon know (the reality).
Again, you will soon know.
No! if you have had sure knowledge (of the Hereafter, you would not have been so distracted)
You will certainly see the Hell,
then you will see it with an eye of certainty.
Then you will be asked about all the pleasures (you enjoyed in the world).
