With the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful.
Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds
the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful
the Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship, and from You alone we seek help.
Guide us in the straight path
the path of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
