'Alif, Lam, Mim.
Do people think that they will be left (at ease) only on their saying, "We believe" and will not be put to test?
And We have surely tested those who were before them. So Allah will surely know the ones who are truthful, and He will surely know the liars.
Is it that those who are committing evils think that they will escape from Us? Evil is what they decide.
Whoever hopes for meeting Allah (must be sure that) Allah's appointed time has to come. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
And whoever strives, strives for his own benefit. Surely Allah is independent of all the worlds.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will expiate their bad deeds and will give them a better reward (than their expectation) for what they used to do.
And We have instructed man to do good to his parents. And if they insist upon you that you should ascribe partners to Me, then do not obey them. To Me is your return; then I shall tell you about what you used to do.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall include them among the righteous.
And among men there are those who say, "We believe in Allah", but when they are persecuted in (the way of) Allah, they take the persecution of men, as equal to the punishment of Allah. And should any help comes from your Lord, they will certainly say, "We were with you." (1) Is it not that Allah knows well what lies in the hearts of the people of all the worlds?
And Allah will certainly know those who believe and He will certainly know the hypocrites.
And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Follow our way, and we will bear the burden of your sins." And they are not (able) to bear the burden of their sins in the least. Indeed they are pure liars.
And they shall certainly bear their own loads, and some loads along with their own loads. And they will certainly be questioned about what they used to forge.
And We sent Nuh to his people. So he stayed with them one thousand, less fifty, years. Then the Cyclone seized them, and they were transgressors.
] So We saved him and the people of the Ark, and made it a sign for all the worlds.
And (We sent) Ibrahim when he said to his people, "Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better for you if you know.
You only worship idols beside Allah and you invent a lie. In fact those whom you worship beside Allah do not have power to give you provision. So seek provision near Allah and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you are to be returned.
And if you belie me, then many nations have belied (their messengers) before you. And the messenger has no obligation but to convey the message clearly."
Did they not see how Allah originates the creation, then He will do it again. Surely this is easy for Allah.
Say, "Go about in the land and look how He has originated the creation. Then Allah will create the subsequent creation. Surely Allah is powerful to do everything."
He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills. And to Him you are to be turned back.
And you are not (able) to frustrate (Allah) neither in the earth nor in the sky. And, apart from Allah, you have neither a protector nor a helper.
And those who deny the signs of Allah and meeting with Him, those will despair of My mercy, and those are the ones for whom there is a painful punishment.
So, the response of his (Ibrahim's) people was none but that they said, "Kill him" or 'Burn him". So Allah saved him from the fire. Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.
And he (Ibrahim) said, "You have taken to idols instead of Allah, only because of love (you have) with each other in the worldly life. Then on the Day of Judgment you will reject each other and will curse one another. And your abode is the Fire, and you will have no helpers."
So Lut believed in him and he (Ibrahim) said, "I am going to leave my homeland towards my Lord. Surely He is the Mighty, the Wise.
And We granted him Ishaque and Ya` qub and assigned to his progeny prophethood and book, and gave him his reward in the world; and of course he, in the Hereafter, is one of the righteous.
And (We sent) Sayyidna Lut (علیہ السلام) when he said to his people, "Indeed you commit the shameful act that no one in the worlds has ever preceded you in it.
Is it (not) a fact that you go for men (to satisfy your lust) and rob the wayfarer and commit evil in your gathering?" So the answer of his people was none but that they said, "Bring us Allah's punishment, if you are one of the truthful."
He said, "My Lord, help me against the people who make mischief."
And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good news, they said, "We are going to destroy the people of this town. Surely its people have been transgressors."
He said, "There is Sayyidna Lut in it." They said, "We know well who is in it. We will certainly save him and his family except his wife who will be among those remaining behind."
And when Our messengers came to Lut, he grieved for them and his heart was straitened because of them, but they said, 'We are going to save you and your family, except your wife who will be among those remaining behind.
We are going to bring down on the people of this town a punishment from the sky, because they used to act sinfully."
And We left from it (the town) an evident sign for a people who understand.
And (We sent) to Madyan their brother Shu` aib. So he said, "O my people, worship Allah and expect the Last Day and do not roam about in the land as mischief makers."
So they belied him, then they were seized by the earthquake and they remained in their homes lying on their faces.
And (We destroyed) ` Ad and Thamud, and it is visible to you through their dwellings. And the Shaitan had beautified for them their deeds, so he prevented them from the (right) way, though they were people of insight.
And (We also destroyed) Qarun and the Pharaoh and Haman. And surely Musa came to them with clear signs; so they acted arrogantly on the earth, and were not (able) to escape.
Thus each one of them We seized for his sin. So to some of them We sent a violent wind; and some of them were seized by a Cry; and some of them We made to sink in the earth; and some of them We drowned. And Allah was not to do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to their own selves.
The example of those who have taken to patrons other than Allah is like the spider that has made a house. And surely the weakest of houses is the house of the spider. If only they know.
Surely, Allah knows whatever thing they invoke beside Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
And these examples We site for people, and no one understands them except the knowledgeable ones.
Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth. Surely in this there is a sign for the believers.
And recite (0 Muhammad) what is revealed to you of the Book and establish Salah. Surely Salah restrains from shamelessness and evil. And indeed remembrance of Allah is the greatest (thing). And Allah knows what you do.
And do not debate with the people of the Book unless it is in the best way, except those from them who commit injustice. And say, "We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit (ourselves)."
And in the same way We have sent down the Book to you. So those to whom We have given the Book believe in it. And from these (the people of Makkah) there are ones who believe in it. And no one rejects Our verses except the infidels.
And you have never been reciting any book before this, nor have you been writing it with your right hand; had it been so, the people of falsehood would have raised doubts.
But it (the Qur'an) is clear verses in the hearts of those who are given knowledge. And no one rejects our verses except the wrongdoers.
And they said, 'Why is it that no signs (miracles) have been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "Signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner."
Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book that is being recited to them? Surely in it there is mercy and advice for a people who believe.
Say, "Allah is enough as a witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in falsity and do not believe in Allah, those are the losers.
And they ask you to bring the punishment soon. And had there not been an appointed time, the punishment would have come to them. And it will surely come to them suddenly while they will not be aware.
And they ask you to bring the punishment soon. And surely the Jahannam is going to overwhelm the disbelievers,
the Day when the punishment will envelop them from above them and from under their feet and He (Allah) will say, "Taste what you used to do."
0 My slaves who believe, surely My earth is vast. So, Me alone you worship.
Every person has to taste death, then to Us you are to be returned.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall accommodate them in mansions of the Paradise beneath which rivers flow, where they will live forever. Excellent is the reward of the workers,
who observe restraint patiently and place their trust in their Lord alone.
And how many an animal there is that does not carry its provision. Allah gives provision to it as well as to you, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-knowing.
And if you ask them as to who has created the heavens and the earth and has subjugated the sun and the moon, they will certainly say, "Allah". How then are they driven aback?
Allah extends provision to whom He wills from His slaves, and straitens it (for whom He wills). Surely Allah knows everything well.
And if you ask them as to who sends down water from the sky, then revives the land with it, they will certainly say, "Allah". Say, "Praise belongs to Allah." But most of them do not understand.
And this worldly life is nothing but an amusement and play, and the Last Abode is the real life indeed. Only if they know!
So when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, having their faith purely in Him. But when He saves them (and brings them) to the land, in no time they start committing shirk (ascribing partners to Allah),
so that they be ungrateful for what We gave to them, and so that they may have enjoyment. So, they will soon come to know (the ill-fate of their attitude).
Did they not see that We have made a peaceful sanctuary ( حرَم haram) while (other) people around them are being snatched away? Do they, then, believe in falsity and reject Allah's grace?
And who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah or belies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not a dwelling in Jahannam for disbelievers?
And those who strive in Our way, We will certainly take them to Our paths, and indeed Allah is with those who are good in deeds.
