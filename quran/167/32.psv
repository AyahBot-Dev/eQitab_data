Alif Lam Meem.
(This) revelation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - is from the Lord of the worlds.
Or, is it that they say, "he has fabricated it." On the contrary, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no warner has come before you; maybe they take the right path.
Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, then He positioned Himself on the Throne. Other than Him, there is neither a guardian for you, nor an intercessor. Would you then not observe the advice?
He manages (every) matter from the sky to the earth, then it (every matter) will ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is a thousand years according to the way you count.
That One is the All-knower of the unseen and the seen; the All-Mighty, the Very-Merciful,
who made well whatever He created and started the creation of man from clay.
Then He made his progeny from a drop of semen, from a despised water.
Then He gave him a proportioned shape and breathed into him of His spirit. And He granted you the (power of) hearing and the eyes and the hearts. Little you give thanks.
And they said, "Is it that when we disappear in the earth, shall we really come into a new creation?" Rather they are ones who deny the meeting with their Lord.
Say, "The angel of death who has been assigned for you will take you in full, then you will be brought back to your Lord."
And (you will wonder) if you see the sinners hanging their heads before their Lord (and saying,) "Our Lord, we have now seen and heard, so send us back, and we will do righteous deeds. Surely, (now) we are believers."
And if We had so willed, We would have given everybody his right way (by force), but the word from Me had come to pass: "I will certainly fill the Jahannam with jinn and human beings together.:
So, have a taste, because you had forgotten the meeting of this day of yours. We have forgotten you. And taste the eternal punishment for what you used to do.
Only those people believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded of them, fall in prostration and pronounce the purity with praise of their Lord, and they do not wax proud.
Their sides remain apart from their beds.They call their Lord with fear and hope, and spend from what We have given to them.
So no one knows what delight of eyes has been reserved for them in secret, as a reward of what they used to do.
So, can one who is a believer become like one who is a sinner? They cannot become equal.
As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them there are gardens to dwell, an honorable hospitality, for what they used to do.
And the ones who disobeyed, their abode is the Fire. Whenever they wish to come out from it, they will be turned back to it, and it will be said to them, "Taste the punishment of fire that you used to deny."
And We will certainly make them taste the nearer punishment before the greater punishment, so that they may return.
And who is more unjust than the one who was reminded of the verses of his Lord, then he turned away from them. Surely, We have to take vengeance upon the sinners.
And We did give the Book to Musa, so do not be in doubt about receiving it, and We made it a guidance for the children of Isra'il.
And We appointed leaders from among them who guided (people) under Our command, when they observed patience, and kept firm belief in Our verses.
Surely, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment in what they used to differ.
Has it not been a source of guidance for them as to how many generations We have destroyed before them who used to walk in their dwellings? Surely in this there are signs. So, do they not listen?
Have they not seen that We drive water to the dry land, then We bring forth crops thereby from which their cattle and they themselves have food? So, do they not observe?
And they say, 'en will this decision take place?"
Say, "On the day of decision their belief will not be of any use to disbelievers, nor shall they be given any respite."
So, turn away from them and wait. They (too) are waiting.
