The reckoning of the people has drawn near to them while they are in negligence, turning away (from its signs).
No new message comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it in a state of playing,
their hearts paying no heed. And the wrongdoers whisper in secret, "This one is nothing but a human like you. Would you then go along with the sorcery while you have eyes to see?"
He (the prophet) said, "My Lord knows all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth, and He is the A11-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Further they said, " (The Qur'an is) a mixture of hotch-potch dreams. Rather, he (the prophet) has fabricated it. Rather, he is a poet. So, let him bring a sign to us, as the earlier ones were sent with."
Not a single town We destroyed did believe before them. So then, will they believe?
And We did not send before you messengers except men whom We inspired with revelation. So, ask the people (having the knowledge) of the Message, if you do not know.
And We did not make them as bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal.
Then We made the promise come true for them, so We saved them and the ones We willed, and destroyed the transgressors.
Surely, We have sent down to you a book having a good name for you. So, do you not understand?
And how many a town We crushed, that were wrong-doing, and We raised up another people after them.
So when they sensed Our punishment, all of a sudden, they started fleeing from it.
Do not flee, and go back to the luxuries you were involved in and to your homes. May be you are asked questions.
They said, "Woe to us! We were wrongdoers indeed."
Then, this continued to be their cry till We turned them into stubble, totally extinguished.
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what lies between them for play.
Had We intended to have a pastime, We would have had it from Our own, if We were to do so.
Instead, We launch the truth against the falsehood, which smashes it, and in no time it is nothing. And woe to you for what you relate.
And to Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth. And those who are near Him are not arrogant against His worship, nor are they sluggish.
They proclaim His purity night and day, never slackening.
Or have they taken to gods from the earth who raise the dead?
Had there been gods in them (the heavens and the earth) other than Allah, both would have fallen in disorder. So pure is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from what they describe.
He is not questioned of what He does, and they are questioned.
Or have they taken to gods besides Him? Say, "Bring your proof." Here is the Message for those with me and the Message for those before me. Yet most of them do not know the truth and therefore they are averse.
And We did not send before you any messenger but We revealed to him that there is no god but I, so worship Me."
And they said, "The Rahman (All-Merciful) has taken to Himself a son". Pure is He. They are but servants, honoured.
They do not precede Him in speech and only under His command they act.
He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and they make recommendation for none but for whom He likes, and in awe of Him they are apprehensive.
And whoever of them says, "I am god besides Him", is the one whom We will recompense with Jahannam. This is how We recompense the transgressors.
Have the disbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were closed, then We opened them? And We created from water every living thing. Would they yet not believe?
And We created mountains on the earth, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein paths and ways, so that they are guided.
And We made the sky a roof, protected; and they are averse to its signs.
And He is the One who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each floating in an orbit.
And We did not assign immortality to any human (even) before you. So, if you die, will they then live forever?
Everyone has to taste death. And We test you all through bad and good (situations) with a trial. And to Us you are to be returned.
And when disbelievers see you, they do nothing but make mockery of you (saying) "Is this the one who talks of your gods?" - while they themselves are the denier of even mentioning the Rahman (All-Merciful).
Man is made of haste. I shall show you My signs, so do not seek haste from Me.
And they say, "When will this promise be (fulfilled), if you are true?"
Only if the disbelievers were to know the time when they will not (be able to) keep off the fire from their faces or from their backs, nor will they be helped.
Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and will baffle them. So they will not be able to turn it back, nor will they be given respite.
And messengers have been mocked at before you. So those who laughed at them were besieged by what they have been mocking at.
Say, "Who will guard you, during night and day, against the Rahman (All-Merciful)?" Rather, to the remembrance of their Lord they are averse.
Or do they have gods who protect them besides Us? They are not able to help even themselves, nor are they allowed by Us to have company.
But We have given benefits to these and their fathers so much so that life prolonged against them. So do they not see that We are coming to the land reducing it from its sides? Then, are they the ones to prevail?
Say, "I simply warn you by revelation, and the deaf do not listen to the call, when they are warned."
And if they are touched by a whiff of the punishment of your Lord, they will certainly say, "Woe to us! We were wrongdoers indeed."
And We shall place scales to do justice on the Day of Judgment. So no one shall be wronged in any way. And even if it (any act, good or evil) is to the measure of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And We are enough to take account.
And We gave Musa and Harun criterion and a light and an advice for the God-fearing,
those who have awe of their Lord, though unseen, and are apprehensive of the Hour.
And this is a blessed advice We have sent down. Is it then you are rejecting it?
And earlier We had given Ibrahim his guidance, and We knew him well,
when he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues you are devoted to?"
They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them,"
He said, "Surely you and your fathers have been in open error."
They said, "Did you come to us with truth or are you of those who make fun?"
He said, No, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who has created them, and I am one of those who bear witness to it.
And I swear by Allah that I will do something to your idols after you are gone, turning your backs."
Then, he turned them into pieces, save the big one of them, so that they may come back to him.
They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He is one of the wrongdoers, indeed".
Some of them said, "We have heard a youth speaking of them. He is called Ibrahim."
They said, 'Then, bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may see".
They said, "Is it you 0 Ibrahim who has done this to our gods?"
He said, "Rather, this is done by this chief of theirs. So, ask them if they were to speak."
So they turned to themselves and said, "In fact, you are the wrongdoers
Then, they reversed their position upside down (saying) "You already knew that they do not speak."
He said, 'Do you then worship, beside Allah, what does neither benefit you in the least nor harm you?
Fie upon you and upon what you worship other than Allah. Do you then not understand?"
They said, " (0 people) burn him and help your gods, if you are to take action."
We said, "0 fire, be cold and safe for Ibrahim."
And they intended to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.
And We rescued him and Lilt towards the land we blessed for all the worlds.
And We blessed him with Islhaq and Ya` qas gift, and each one of them We made righteous.
And We made them the imams who guide (people) under Our command, and We inspired them to do good deeds and to establish , salah and pay zahah. And Us alone they worshipped.
As for Lilt, We gave him wisdom and knowledge and We delivered him from the town that used to do dirty deeds. Indeed, they were the people of evil, the sinners.
And We admitted him to Our mercy. Indeed, He was of the righteous.
And (remember) when he called (for help) earlier, so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the terrible agony,
and helped him against the people who belied Our verses. Indeed, they were the people of evil, therefore, We drowned them all.
And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they were adjudicating about the tillage, when the goats of the people wandered therein grazing, and We were witness to their judgment.
So, We enabled Sulayman to understand it. And to each one of them We gave wisdom and knowledge. And with Dawud We subjugated the mountains that proclaimed the purity of Allah, and the birds as well. And We were the One who did (it).
And We taught him making of armour as dress for you, to protect you from what may harm you (in combat). So are you grateful?
And for Sulayman, (We subjugated) the violent wind that blew under his command to the land in which We placed Our blessings. And We were the One who knew everything.
And from the devils, (We subjugated for him) those who dived in water for him and did jobs other than that. And We were the One who kept watch over them.
And (remember) Ayyub, when he called his Lord saying, "Here I am, afflicted by pain and You are the most merciful of all the merciful."
So, We answered his prayer and removed whatever pain he had, and gave him (back) his family and the like thereof along with them, as a mercy from Our own Self and as a lesson for the worshippers.
And (remember) Ismail and Idris and Dhul-Kifl. Each one of them was of those who observed patience.
And We admitted them to Our mercy. Surely, they were of the righteous.
And (remember) Dhunnun (the man of the fish, namely Yunus), when he walked away in anger and thought that We will never put him to trouble. Then, he called (Us) in depths of darkness saying, "There is no god but You. Pure are You. Indeed I was among the wrongdoers".
So We responded to him and rescued him from the distress. And this is how We rescue the believers.
And (remember) Zakariyya when he called his Lord, "0 my Lord do not leave me alone and You are the best of inheritors."
So, We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his wife good for him. They used to race towards the good deeds and call Us with hope and fear; and they were humble to Us.
And (remember) her who protected her private part. So, We blew in her (a life) through Our Spirit, and made her and her son a sign for all the worlds. [ 91]
Surely, this is the fraternity of your Faith, a single Faith, and I am your Lor'; so worship Me.
And they split up their ways from one another. All of them have to return to Us.
So, the one who does righteous deeds, while he is a believer, his effort will not be rejected and We are to put it on record.
It is banned for (the people of) a town We destroyed that they come back
until when the Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) are released, while they run down from every height,
and the True Promise draws near, then suddenly the eyes of the disbelievers shall remain upraised (in terror and they will say,) "Woe to us! We were neglectful to this; rather we were transgressors indeed."
Surely, you and whatever you worship other than Allah are the fuel of Jahannam. There you will have to arrive.
Had they been gods, they would not have arrived at it. And all of them will remain there forever.
There are screams for them therein and they will not hear.
Surely, those for whom the good (news) from Us has come earlier shall be kept far away from it.
They will not hear the slightest of its sound, and they will remain for ever in what their selves desire.
They shall not be grieved by the Biggest Panic, and the angels shall receive them (saying), "This is your day that you had been promised"
the Day when We roll up the sky like a scroll rolls up the writings. As We originated the first creation, We shall bring it back again - a promise (undertaken to be binding) on Us. We are sure to do it.
And We have written in Zabur (Psalms) after the Dhikr (the Torah) that the land will be inherited by My righteous slaves.
Surely, in this (the Qur'an) there is a message conveyed to a people who worship (Allah).
And We have not sent you but as mercy for all the worlds.
Say, "What is revealed to me is simply that your God is One God. So do you submit?"
But, if they turn away, then say (to them), 'I have warned you all alike, and I do not know whether what you have been warned of is near or far.
Surely, He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you conceal.
And I do not know; perhaps it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a while."
He (Our Messenger) said, "My Lord, judge with truth. And Our Lord is the Rahman (All-Merciful), the One whose help is sought against what you describe.
