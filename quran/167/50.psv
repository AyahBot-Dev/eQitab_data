Qaf. (I swear) by the glorious Qur'an, (you are sent as a messenger.)
But they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves, so the disbelievers said, "This is something strange.
Is it when we die and become dust (that we will be brought to life again?) That is a return, far (from understanding)."
We know very well how much of them is diminished by the earth, and We have a Book that records everything.
Rather, they rejected the truth when it came to them; so they are in a confused state.
Did they not, then, look to the sky above them, how We have built it and beautified it, and it has no cracks?
And the earth-We have spread it out, and cast on it firm hills, and caused to grow therein every kind of delightful things,
as a source of vision and as a lesson to every slave (of Allah) who turns (to Him for guidance).
And We sent down blessed water from the sky, and caused to grow therewith gardens and grain of harvest,
and towering date palms that have spadices, put one upon another,
as a provision to the slaves (of Allah). And We gave life with it to a dead land. Similar will be the exit (of the dead from their graves).
It (resurrection) was rejected prior to them by the people of Nuh, and the people of Rass and Thamud,
and ` Ad, and Fir'aun, and the brothers of Lut,
and dwellers of Aykah, and the people of Tubba'. Each one of them rejected the messengers; so My threat came true.
Is it then that We were worn out by the first creation? No, but they are in confusion about the new creation.
And indeed We have created man, and We know whatever thoughts his inner self develops, and We are closer to him than (his) jugular vein,
when the two receiving angels receive (every human act to record it), seated (one) on the right and (one) on the left.
Not a single word is uttered by one, but there is a watcher near him, ready (to record).
And the daze of death has (to) come with truth. That is what you tried to escape.
And the Horn will be blown. That will be the day of (which) threat (was given).
And everybody will come, along with one (angel) to drive (him to the field of reckoning) and one (angel) to testify (about his deeds).
You were heedless of this. Now We have removed your veil from you; so your sight today is sharp."
] And his companion (i.e. the angel who recorded his deeds) will say, "This is what I have with me, ready (to be presented as his record of deeds)."
(Then it will be said,) "Cast, both of you (0 angels,) into Jahannam (hell) every stubborn disbeliever
who used to prevent (others) from good, who transgressed all bounds, who cast doubts (in true faith),
who used to prevent (others) from good, who transgressed all bounds, who cast doubts (in true faith),
His (evil) companion (i.e. the Satan) will say, "0 our Lord, I did not cause him to rebel, but he was himself (involved) in straying far from the track.
He (Allah) will say, "Do not quarrel before Me, while I had sent to you My threat well in advance.
The Word is not changed with Me, and I Am not a wrongdoer to My slaves."
(Remind them of) the Day when We will say to Jahannam (hell), "Are you filled up?" and it will say, "Are there some more?"
And the Jannah (Paradise) will be brought close for the God-fearing, no longer distant.
(And it will be said) " This is what you were promised for everyone oft-returning to Allah, vigilant (against sins),
the one who fears the Rahman (The All-Merciful), without seeing Him, and comes up with a heart oriented towards Him.
Enter it in peace. That is the Day of Eternity."
For them there will be whatever they wish, and with Us there is even more.
And how many a generations We have destroyed before them who were stronger than these in their grip on power, and they searched out the cities: Was there any place to escape?
Indeed, there is a lesson in all this for him who has a heart and gives ear (to the truth) attentively.
And We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and no weariness even touched Us.
So, bear with patience what they say, and proclaim His purity along with your Lord's praise before sunrise and before sunset.
And in hours of night, do proclaim His purity, and at the ends of prostration.
And listen: The Day when the caller will call out from a near place,
the Day they will hear the Cry in reality-that will be the Day of Resurrection.
Surely We alone give life and bring death, and to Us is the final return
on the Day when the earth will burst apart exposing them, while they will be hurrying up (to come out). That is a mustering, so easy for Us.
We know well what they say, and you are not one to compel them. So give advice, through the Qur'an, to the one who fears My warning.
