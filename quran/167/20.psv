Ta-Ha [ 1]
We did not reveal the Qur'an to you to (make you) face hardship
rather to remind him who has the fear
a revelation from the One Who created the earth, and the heavens so high.
The Rahman (the All-Merciful) has positioned Himself on the Throne.
To Him belongs whatever there is in the heavens, whatever there is in the earth, whatever there is between them and whatever there is beneath the soil.
And if you pronounce the word aloud, then (it makes no difference, for) He certainly knows the secret and what is even more hidden.
(Such is) Allah. There is no god but He. For Him are the Beautiful Names.
And has there come to you the story of Musa?
When he saw a fire and said to his family, "Wait. I have noticed a fire. Perhaps I bring you an ember from it, or find some guidance by the fire."
So when he came to it, he was called, "0 Musa,
it is Me, your Lord, so remove your shoes; you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed:
Surely, I AM ALLAH. There is no god but I, so worship Me and establish Salah for My remembrance.
Surely, the Hour has to come. I would keep it secret so that everyone is given a return for the effort one makes.
So the one who does not believe in it and follows his desires must not make you neglectful of it, otherwise you will perish.
And what is that in your right hand, 0 Musa?"
He said, "It is my staff. I lean on it, and with it I beat down leaves for my sheep, and for me it has many other uses."
He said, 'Throw it down 0 Musa'.
So, he threw it down, and suddenly it was a snake, running.
He said, "Pick it up and be not scared. We shall restore it to its former state.
And put your hand under your arm and it will come out white, without any disease as another sign,
so that We may show you some of Our great signs.
Go to the Pharaoh. He has really transgressed."
He said, "My Lord, put my heart at peace for me
and make my task easy for me
and remove the knot from my tongue,
that they may understand my speech.
And make for me an assistant from my own family:
Harun, my brother.
Enhance with him-my strength,
and make him share my task,
so that we proclaim Your purity a lot
and remember You a lot.
-You are certainly watchful over us."
He said, "You have been granted your request 0 Musa.
And We have bestowed Our favour on you once more,
when We revealed to your mother what was to be revealed,
that is, 'Put him (the baby) in the chest, then cast it into the river, then let the river throw it by the shore and it will be picked up by one who is enemy to Me and enemy to him". And I have cast love on you from Myself, and that you are fashioned under My eye.
(Remember) when your sister was going (to the family of the Pharaoh) and was saying, "Shall I point you to one who nurses him?" Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that her eyes might be cooled and she does not grieve. And you had killed a person, then We brought you out of the trouble; and We tested you with a great ordeal. Then you lived a number of years amidst the people of Madyan. After all this, you came 0 Musa, to a point, destined.
And I have fashioned you for Myself.
Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not be slack in My remembrance.
Go, both of you, to the Pharaoh; he has indeed transgressed.
So speak to him in soft words. May be, he takes to the advice or fears (Allah) ".
They said, "Our Lord, we are afraid he will hasten to commit excess against us, or will cross all bounds."
He said, 'Do not be afraid. I am surely with you both I hear and I see.
So, come to him and say, 'We are the messengers of your Lord. So, let the children of Isra'il go with us, and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace be upon the one who follows the guidance.
Verily, it has been revealed to us that the punishment is for the one who denies and turns away."'
He (the Pharaoh) said, "Who then is the Lord of you two, O Musa?"
He (Musa) said, "Our Lord is He who gave everything its shape, then guidance."
He said, 'Then, what about the earlier generations?"
He replied, "The knowledge about those is, in a book, with my Lord. My Lord does neither err nor forget.
(He is) the One who made the earth a cradle for you and made for you therein pathways to move, and sent down water from the heavens and brought out, with it, pairs of different vegetations:
Eat, and graze ypur cattle. Surely, in that there are signs for the people of understanding."
From this (earth) We created you and in this we shall put you back and from this We shall raise you up once again.
And We showed him (the Pharaoh) all Our signs, yet he belied and refused.
Said he, "Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your sorcery, 0 1Vlusa?
We will, then, bring to you a similar sorcery. So, make, between you and us, an appointment not to be backed out, neither by us nor from you - at an even place."
He (Miisa) said, "Your appointment is the festival day and that the people are assembled at forenoon."
So, the Pharaoh turned back, and put his plot together, then came.
-usa said to them, 'Pity on you, do not fabricate a lie against Allah, lest He uproots you with a punishment. And loser is he who fabricates a lie."
Then, they disputed among themselves in their matter and kept their talk secret.
Said they, "Certainly, these two are sorcerers who wish to drive you out from your land and do away with your excellent way of life.
So, make your plot firm and come forth in one row. And successful today is he who stands high."
They said, "0 Musa, either you throw, or shall we be the first to throw?"
He said, "Rather, you throw." Then, suddenly their ropes and sticks seemed to him, due to their magic, as if they were running.
So, (علیہ السلام) Musa concealed some fear in his heart.
We said, "Do not be scared. Certainly, you are to be the upper most.
And throw what is in your right hand, and it will devour what they have concocted. What they have concocted is but a sleight of a magician. And the magician does not succeed wherever he comes from."
So, the magicians were led (by the truth) to fall in prostration. They said, "We have (now) believed in the Lord of Harun and Musa."
He (the Pharaoh) said, "You have believed in him before I permit you. He is, in fact your chief who has taught you the magic. So I will certainly cut apart your hands and your legs from opposite sides and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall know who of us is more severe in punishment, and more lasting."
They said, "We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us and over Him who has created us. So, do whatever you are to do. You will do only for this worldly life.
We have believed in our Lord, so that He forgives us from our sins and from the magic you had compelled us on. And Allah is the best and everlasting."
Surely whoever comes to his Lord as a sinner, for him there is Jahannam wherein he neither dies nor lives.
And whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds, for such people there are the highest ranks,
the eternal gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they shall live forever. And that is the reward for one who has purified himself.
And We revealed to Musa saying, "Move out with my servants at night, then make for them a dry path in the sea (with the strike of your staff), neither fearing to be caught up nor being scared (of anything else)."
] Then the Pharaoh chased them with his troops. So covered they were, by that which covered them from the sea.
And the Pharaoh led his people astray and did not show them the right path.
0 children of Isra'il, We delivered you from your enemy and appointed for you the right side of the mount Tiir (Sinai) and sent down for you the Mann and Salwa:
Eat from the good things We have provided you with, and do not transgress in respect thereof, lest My wrath befalls upon you. And the one upon whom befalls My wrath certainly falls into destruction.
And surely I am the Most-Forgiving for him who repents and believes and acts righteously, then takes to the right path.
"And what has caused you to hurry before your people, 0 Musa?"
He said, "Here they are just behind me, and I hurried towards You, 0 my Lord, so that You be pleased."
He said, "We have then put your people to test after you (left them) and Samiri has misguided them."
So, Musa went back to his people in anger and sorrow. He said, "0 my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Did then the time become too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord befalls you, and hence you backed out from the promise made to me?"
They said, "We did not back out, of our own volition, of the promise made to you, but we were burdened with loads from the ornaments of the people; so we threw them and so did throw Samiri."
Then he brought forth for them a calf, a body with a lowing sound. Then they said, "This is your god and the god of Musa, and he (Musa) erred."
Do they not then see that it does not respond to them with a word, nor does it have power to harm or benefit them?
And Harun had already said to them, "0 my people, you have only been led astray with it, and your Lord is the Rahman (All-Merciful). So follow me and obey my command."
They said, "We will never discontinue staying with it, until Musa returns to us."
He (Musa) said, "0 Harun what did prevent you from following me when you saw them going astray?
Did you then disobey my command?"
He said, "0 son of my mother, do not hold me by my beard, nor by my head. I feared that you would say, 'You have caused discord among the children of Isra'il and did not observe my advice."
He (Musa) said, 'What then is your case, 0 Samiri?"
He said, "I perceived something they perceived not. So I picked up a handful of dust from under the foot of the messenger (the angel). Then, I cast it. And thus my inner self tempted me."
He (Musa) said, 'Then go away, for your fate in this life is to say: 'Do not touch me'. And, of course, you have another promise, never to be held back from you. And look at your god to which you stayed devoted. We will certainly burn it, then we will scatter it thoroughly in the sea.
Your God is Allah other than whom there is no god. He encompasses everything with knowledge."
Thus We narrate to you certain events of what has passed, and We have given to you, from Ourself, a (book of) advice.
Whoever turns away from it shall certainly bear a heavy burden on the Doomsday,
all such people living under it forever. And how evil for them is that burden on the Doomsday!
The Day when the Horn (Sur) will be blown and We shall gather them together that day, while turned blue,
whispering among themselves, "You did not remain (in graves) more than ten (days) ".
We very well know what they say, when the best of them in his ways will say, "You did not remain more than a day."
And they ask you about the mountains. So, you say, "My Lord will blow them up totally (as dust),
then will turn them into a levelled plain
in which you will" see neither a curve nor a mound.
That day they will follow the caller, having no crookedness. And the voices will turn low in awe for the Rahman (All-Merciful). So, you will hear not but whispering.
That day no intercession will be of any use to anyone, except the one whom the Ralhman (All-Merciful) has permitted and was pleased with his word.
He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge.
And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Alive, the All-Sustaining. And the loser is the one who bears (the burden of his) transgression.
And whoever does acts from righteous deeds, while he is a believer, shall fear neither injustice nor curtailment (of his rewards).
And in this way We have sent it down to you, an Arabic Qur'an, and have detailed therein some warnings repeatedly, so that they may be fearful or it may produce a lesson for them.
So High above all is Allah, the King, the True. And do not hasten with (reciting) the Qur'an before its revelation to you is concluded, and say, "My Lord, improve me in knowledge."
And earlier We had given a directive to 'Adam, then he forgot, and We did not find in him a firm resolve.
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before 'Adam". So, they prostrated, all but Iblis who refused.
So, We said "0 'Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not expel you from Paradise, lest you get into trouble.
Here you are privileged that you will not be hungry nor will you be unclad,
and you will not be thirsty, nor will you be exposed to sun."
Then the Shaitan instigated him. He said, "0 'Adam, shall I guide you to the tree of eternity and to an empire that does not decay?"
So, both of them ('Adam and Eve) ate from it, and their parts of she were exposed to them, and they started stitching on themselves some of the leaves of Paradise. And 'Adam disobeyed his Lord, and erred.
Thereafter his Lord chose him. So He accepted his repentance and gave (him) guidance.
He said, " (0 'Adam and Eve) Go down from here, all of you, some of you enemies of some. Then, should some guidance come to you from Me, the one who follows My guidance shall not go astray, nor shall he be in trouble.
And whoever turns away from My message shall have a straitened life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Judgment"
He will say, "My Lord, why did you raise me blind while I was sighted?"
He will say, "Like this Our signs came to you and you had ignored them. And in the same way you will be ignored today."
And thus We recompense him who exceeds the limits and does not believe in the signs of his Lord. And certainly the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.
Did it give them no guidance, as to how many generations We have destroyed before them who used to walk in their dwellings? Surely, in this there are signs for the people of understanding.
And had there not been a word from your Lord that had come earlier, and an appointed time, it (the punishment) would have been inevitable.
So, (0 messenger) endure what they say and proclaim the purity and praise of your Lord before the sun rises and before it sets. And in some hours of night proclaim His purity, as well as at the edges of the day, so that you may be pleased.
And never stretch your eyes towards what we have given to groups of them to enjoy, the glamor of the worldly life, so that We put them to test thereby. And the bounty of your Lord is better and lasting.
And bid your family to perform Salah and adhere to it yourself. We ask no provision from you. We give provision to you. And the end is in favour of Taqwa.
And they said, "Why does he not bring to us sign from his Lord?" Has there not come to them the manifestation of that which was contained in the earlier scriptures?
And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and put to disgrace?"
Say, "Everyone is waiting. So wait, then you will know who are the people of the straight path and who has guidance.
