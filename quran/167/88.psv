Has there come to you the description of the Overwhelming Event?
Many faces on that day will be humbled,
working hard, exhausted.
They will enter into the scorching fire.
They will be made to drink water from a boiling spring.
There will be no food for them except from a thorny plant
that will neither nourish, nor satisfy hunger.
Many faces on that day will be full of glamour,
well pleased with their endeavour,
in a lofty garden,
in which they will not hear any absurd talk.
In it there is a running spring.
In it there are couches, elevated,
and goblets, well placed
and cushions, arrayed
and carpets, spread around.
So, do they not look at the camels how they are created,
and at the sky, how it is raised high,
and at the mountains, how they are installed,
and at the earth, how it is spread out?
So, keep on preaching; you are only a preacher.
You are not a taskmaster set up over them,
but whoever turns away and disbelieves,
Allah will punish him with the greatest torment.
Surely towards Us they have to return,
then it is Our job to call them to account.
