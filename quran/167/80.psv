He (the Holy Prophet %) frowned and turned his face,
because the blind man came to him!
And what could tell you (0 Holy Prophet about the prospects of the blind man?) May be, (if you had attended him properly,) he would have attained purity,
or have taken to the advice, and the advice would have benefited him.
As for the one who does not care (about faith),
] you are anxious to pursue him,
while there is no blame on you, if he does not attain purity.
as regards the one who has come to you rushing eagerly,
while he fears (Allah),
to him you pay no heed!
Never! (you should never act in this way,) Indeed this (Qurâ€™ an) is an advice.
So, whoever so wills, let him remember it.
It is (recorded) in those scripts (of the Preserved Tablet) that are honoured,
] exalted, purified,
in the hands of those scribes
who are honourable, righteous.
Death be unto the man! How ungrateful he is!
] From which stuff did He (Allah) create him?
From a drop of semen! He created him, and designed him in due proportion,
] then He made the way easy for him,
Later, he made him die, and put him into the grave,
thereafter, when He will intend, He will raise him up.
No! He has not yet fulfilled what He (Allah) had commanded him.
So, let the man look to his food,
] how well We poured water,
then how nicely We split the earth,
then We grew in it grain,
and grapes and greens,
and olive and date-palms,
] and gardens, full of thick trees,
and fruits and fodder,
as a benefit for you and your cattle.
So when there will come the Deafening Noise,
the Day when one will flee from his brother,
and from his mother and father,
and from his wife and sons,
every one of them will have enough concern to make him careless of others.
Many faces, on that day, will be bright,
laughing, rejoicing,
and many faces, on that day, will be stained with dust,
covered by darkness.
Those are the disbelievers, the nefarious.
