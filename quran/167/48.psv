Surely, We have granted you an open victory,
so that Allah may forgive you of your previous and subsequent faults, and may complete His favour upon you, and may guide you to a straight path,
and so that Allah may support you with a mighty support.
He (Allah) is such that He sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, so that they grow more in faith along with their (existing) faith - And to Allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise -
so that He admits the believing men and the believing women to the gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein for ever, and so that He may write off their evil deeds and that is a great achievement in Allah's sight,
and so that He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the mushriks, men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allah. Upon them there is a vicious circle, and Allah has become angry with them, and He has prepared Jahannam for them, and it is an evil destination.
And to Allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Indeed, We have sent you (0 Prophet,) as a witness and as a bearer of good news and as a warner,
so that you (0 people,) believe in Allah and His Messenger, and support him and revere him, and pronounce His (Allah's) purity morning and evening.
Those who pledge allegiance with you by placing their hands in your hand they, in fact, pledge allegiance with Allah. Allah's hand is over their hands. Then, whoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own detriment, and whoever fulfils the covenant he has made with Allah, He will give him a great reward.
Those of the Bedouins who remained behind will say to you, "Our possessions and our families kept us busy, (hence we could not accompany you in your journey to Hudaibiyah). So, pray to Allah for our forgiveness." They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, "Then, who has power to avail you in anything against Allah, if He intends to do you harm, or intends to do you good? Rather, Allah is fully aware of what you do.
No, but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never ever return to their families, and it seemed good to your hearts, and you thought an evil thought and became a ruined people."
And if one does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We have prepared a blazing fire for the disbelievers.
And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whomsoever He wills, and punishes whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.
And those who remained behind will say, when you will proceed to the spoils (of war) to receive them, "Let us follow you." They wish to change the statement of Allah. Say, 'You shall not follow us. Allah had said like this beforehand." Then they will say, "No, but you are jealous of us." On the contrary, they do not understand (the reality) but a little.
Say to those of the Bedouins who remained behind, "You will be called against a people possessed of strong fighting power; you will have to fight them, or they will submit. So if you obey, Allah will give you a good reward, and if you turn away, as you had turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.
There is no blame on the blind, nor is there any blame on the lame, nor is there any blame on the sick. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. And whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful punishment.
Allah was pleased with the believers when they were pledging allegiance with you by placing their hands in your hands under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them, and rewarded them with a well-nigh victory,
and many spoils that they would receive. And Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Allah had promised you many spoils that you would receive, so He gave these to you sooner, and stopped the hands of the people from (harming) you. And (He did this) so that it becomes a sign for the believers, and so that He guides you to the right path.
And (there are) other (victories) that have not come within your power as yet, (but) Allah has encompassed them. And Allah is Powerful over everything.
And had the disbelievers fought you, they would have certainly turned their backs, then they would have found neither a supporter nor a helper -
- according to the consistent practice of Allah that went on since before, and you will never find a change in Allah's consistent practice.
And He is the One who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah after He had let you prevail over them, and Allah is watchful over what you do.
They are those who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram), and (prevented) the sacrificial animals that were detained from reaching their due place. And (Allah would have allowed you to fight,) had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might have trampled them, and thus an embarrassing situation might have befallen you because of them unknowingly, (but this was avoided) so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills. And if they (the believing men and women) had been separate (from disbelievers), We would surely have punished those of them who disbelieved with a painful punishment.
When the disbelievers developed in their hearts indignation, the indignation of ignorance; then Allah sent down tranquility from Himself upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and made them stick to the word of piety, and they were very much entitled to it, and competent for it. And Allah is All-Knowing about everything.
Indeed, Allah has made true to His Messenger the dream (shown) with truth: You will most definitely enter the Sacred Mosque inshaâ€™ Allah (if Allah wills,) peacefully, with your heads shaved, and your hairs cut short, having no fear. So He knew what you did not know, and He assigned before that a well-nigh victory.
He is the One who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the religion of truth, so that He makes it prevail over all religions. And Allah suffices as a witness.
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are hard against the disbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down in Ruku`, prostrating in Sajdah, seeking bounty from Allah and (His) good pleasure; their distinguishing feature is on their faces from the effect of Sajdah (prostration). This is their description in the Torah; and their description in the Injil is: like a sown crop that brings forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem, looking good to the farmers, - so that He may enrage the disbelievers through them. Allah has promised forgiveness and a huge reward to those of them who believe and do good deeds.
