Woe to every backbiter, derider
who accumulates wealth and counts it.
He thinks that his wealth has made him eternal.
Never! He will certainly be thrown into the Crusher.
And what may let you know what the Crusher is?
It is Allah's kindled fire,
that will peep into the hearts.
It will be closed on them,
in outstretched columns.
