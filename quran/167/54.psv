So they said, "Shall we follow a single human being from among us? Then we will be in error and insanity.

Tomorrow they will know who is the bragging liar!
We are going to send the She-camel as a trial for them; so watch them (0 Salih,) and keep patience,
and tell them that water (of the well) is to be shared between them (and the She-camel), so as the right of having water shall be attended by each (alternatively).

We sent upon them a rain of stones, except the family of Lut whom We saved in the last hours of night, as a grace from Us.
This is how We reward the one who offers gratitude.
And he (Lut) had certainly warned them of Our grasp, but they disputed the warnings.

And everything, small and big, is written down.
Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and rivers,
in a seat of Truth, near to the Omnipotent Sovereign
