The Imminent Happening!
What is the Imminent Happening?
And what can let you know what the Imminent happening is?
Thamud and ` Ad had denied (the happening of) the Shocking Event (the Day of Judgment).
As for Thamud, they were destroyed by that (dreadful cry) which exceeded all limits.
And as for ` Ad, they were destroyed by a violent windstorm
that He imposed on them for seven nights and eight consecutive days, so you could see them thrown on the ground, as if they were trunks of hollow palm-trees.
So, do you see any remnant of them?
And Fir'aun (the Pharaoh) and those before him and the overthrown towns came up with evil.
And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an extremely severe seizure.
When the water overflowed (in the Deluge of Nuh), We let you (0 mankind,) board the floating ship,
] so that We make it for you a reminder, and so that a preserving ear may preserve it.
Then, when the Trumpet will be blown for the first time,
] and the earth and the mountains will be lifted and crushed into pieces with a single blow,
then on that Day the Happening will happen,
and the sky will burst apart, while it will have become frail on that day.
And the angels will be on its borders. And on that Day, the Throne of your Lord will be carried above them by eight (angels).
On that day, you will be brought forward in a way that no secret of yours will remain secret.
Now, as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say (to his colleagues), "Come here, read my book.
I was sure that I would encounter my reckoning."
So he will be in a well-pleasing life
] in a lofty garden,
the fruits of which will be close at hand.
(It will be said to such people,) "Eat and drink with pleasure, as a reward for what you did in advance during past days."
As for him who will be given his book in his left hand, he will say, " Oh, would that I had not been given my book,
and I had never known what my account is!
Oh, would that it (death) had been the end of the matter!
My wealth has not been of any use to me.
My power has gone from me for good."
(Then it will be said to angels,) "Seize him, then put a collar around his neck,
then, in the blazing fire let him burn.
Thereafter, fasten him with a chain the measure of which is seventy hands."
Indeed, he did not believe in Almighty Allah,
and did not persuade (others) to feed the needy.
So, he has no friend here today,
nor any food except from that which flows from wounds when washing,
which is eaten by none but the sinners.
I swear by what you see,
and what you do not see,
it is surely the speech of a noble Messenger, (that he conveys from Allah).
and it is not the speech of a poet, (but) little you believe,
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer, (but) little you heed to the advice.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
And had he forged some statements in Our name,
We would have certainly seized him by the right hand,
and then severed his life-artery,
so no one from you would have been an impediment against it.
And it is a Reminder for the God-fearing.
And, of course, We know that among you there are deniers.
And surely, it is an anguish for the disbelievers.
And it is surely an absolute truth.
So, pronounce the purity of the name of your magnificent Lord.
