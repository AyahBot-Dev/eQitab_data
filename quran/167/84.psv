When the sky will split apart,
and will listen to (the command of) its Lord, and it ought to,
and when the earth will be stretched (to give room to more people),
and it will throw up whatever it contains, and will become empty,
and will listen to (the command of) its Lord, and it ought to, (then man will see the consequences of his deeds.)
0 man, you have to work hard constantly to reach your Lord, then you have to meet Him.
So, as for him whose book (of deeds) will be given to him in his right hand,
he will be called to account in an easy manner,
and he will go back to his people joyfully.
As for the one whose book (of deeds) will be given to him from his back side,
he will pray for death,
and will enter the blazing fire.
He had been joyful among his people.
He thought he would never revert (to Allah).
Why not? Indeed his Lord was watchful over him.
So, I swear by the twilight (after sunset),
and by the night and what it envelops,
and by the moon when it develops at the full,
you shall certainly ascend from stage to stage.
So, what has happened to them that they do not believe
and when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not offer sajdah (prostration)?
Rather, those who disbelieve deny (the truth).
And Allah is most aware of what they store.
So give him the 'good news' of a painful punishment,
but those who believed and did righteous deeds, for them there is a reward that will never be interrupted.
