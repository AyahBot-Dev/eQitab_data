About what are they asking each other?
About the Great Event
in which they dispute!
Truly, they will soon know.
Again, truly, they will soon know.
Did We not make the earth as a floor,
and the mountains as pegs?
And We have created you in pairs,
and made your sleep a source of rest,
and made the night a covering,
and made the day a source of livelihood.
And We have built seven strong (skies),
and created a luminous lamp (the sun).
] And We have sent down from the rain-laden clouds abundant water,
so that We bring out there with grain and vegetation,
and thick gardens.
Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time,
a day when the trumpet will be blown, so you will come in multitudes,
and the sky will be opened, so it will become as gates,
and the mountains will be set in motion, so they will be as mirage.
Surely Jahannam (the Hell) is set in ambush.
(It is) an abode for the rebellious people
who will be abiding in it for ages.
They will taste nothing cool in it, nor a drink,
except boiling water and pus,
] this being a recompense in full accord (with their deeds).
They did not expect (to face) accounting (of their deeds),
and they rejected Our signs totally.
And everything (from their deeds) is thoroughly recorded by Us in writing.
"So now taste! We will never add to you anything except torment."
For the God-fearing there is sure achievement,
gardens and grapes,
and buxom maidens of matching age,
and goblets filled up to the brim.
They will not hear therein any vain talk, nor lies,
this being a reward from their Lord, a sufficing grant,
(from) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the All-Merciful. No one will have power to address Him,
on the Day when the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows. They will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the Ralhman (the All-Merciful) and speaks aright.
That is the Day which is sure to come. So whoever so wishes may take refuge with his Lord.
We have warned you of an approaching torment (that will be inflicted) on a day when one will see what his hands have sent ahead, and the disbeliever will say, "0 would that I had become dust!"
