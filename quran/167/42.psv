Ha Meem
` Ayn Seen Qaf
]. This is how Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, sends revelation to you and to those who were before you.
To him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And He is the High, the Supreme.
The heavens almost burst apart from their above side, and the angels proclaim the purity and praise of their Lord, and pray for the forgiveness of those on the earth. Be aware that Allah is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful.
And those who have adopted patrons instead of Him, Allah is on watch against them, and you are not responsible for them.
And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur'an, so that you may warn the town that is the mother of all towns, and those around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Gathering, about which there is no doubt (when) one group of people will be in Paradise, and another group in the blazing Fire.
And had Allah willed, He would have made all of them a single group; but He admits whomsoever He wills into His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, they have neither a patron nor a helper.
Is it that they have adopted patrons instead of Him? So, it is Allah who is the Patron, and He gives life to the dead, and He is Powerful to do everything.
And (Say 0 prophet to your opponents,) "Whatever dispute you have in any matter, its judgment lies with Allah. That One is Allah, the Lord of mine; in Him alone I have placed my trust, and to Him alone I turn (in every matter)."
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs from the cattle. He makes you expand in this way. Nothing is like Him. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision for whomsoever He wills and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills). Surely He is All-Knowing in respect of everything.
He has ordained for you the same religion as He had enjoined upon Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We had enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and ` Isa by saying, " Establish the religion, and be not divided therein." Arduous for the mushriks (polytheists) is that to which you are inviting them. Allah chooses (and pulls) toward Himself anyone He wills, and guides to Himself anyone who turns to Him (to seek guidance).
And they were not divided, in jealousy with each other, but after the knowledge had come to them. And had it not been for a word that had come forth earlier from your Lord (and was effective) until a specified time, the matter would have been decided between them. And those who were made to inherit the Book after them are in confounding doubt about it.
So, (0 prophet,) towards that (faith) invite (people), and be steadfast as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, "I believe in whatever book Allah has sent down. And I have been ordered to do justice among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you, your deeds. There is no argumentation between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the final return."
And those who argue about Allah after He has been responded tol, their argument is void in the sight of their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.
Allah is the One who has sent down the Book with truth, and the Balance as well. And what can let you know? May be, the Hour is near.
Those who do not believe in it demand for its coming soon, and those who believe are fearful of it, and know it to be a truth. Be aware that those who dispute concerning the Hour are wandering afar from the right path.
Allah is kind to His slaves. He gives provision to whom He wills. And He is the Strong, the Mighty.
Whoever intends (to have) the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase in his harvest; and whoever intends (to have) the harvest of the world (only), We will give him thereof, while in the Hereafter there is no share for him.
Is it that they have associate-gods who have prescribed for them a religion that is not sanctioned by Allah? And, had it not been for a decisive word, the matter would have been decided between them (here in this world). And of course, for the wrongdoer there is a painful punishment (in the Hereafter).
You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they earned, and (the punishment) it (entails) is sure to befall them. As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they will be in meadows of the Gardens. For them there is, with their Lord, whatever they wish. That is the great bounty.
That is the good news that Allah gives to His slaves who believed and did righteous deeds. Say, "I do not ask you any fee for it, except the love of kinship." And whoever performs a good act, for him We will increase goodness therein. Surely Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very Appreciative.
Is it that they say, "He has forged a lie against Allah"? So, if Allah wills, He may put a seal on your heart.1 And Allah blots out falsehood and establishes truth with His words. Surely, He is fully aware of what lies in the hearts.
And He is the One who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives evil deeds, and knows whatever you do.
And He responds to (the prayer of) those who believe and do righteous deeds, and gives them more out of His grace. As for the disbelievers, for them there is a severe punishment.
And should Allah expand the provision for His slaves (to its full extent), they would spread mischief on earth; but He sends down what He wills in (due) measure. Surely, with regard to His slaves, He is All-Aware, Ever-Watchful.
And He is the One who sends down rain after they have lost hope, and He extends His mercy. And He is the Guardian, Worthy of all praise.
And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and of the creatures He has spread in them. And He is Powerful to assemble them whenever He so wills.
And whatever hardship befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed, while He overlooks many (of your faults).
And you are not able to frustrate (Him) in the earth. And, besides Allah, you have neither someone to protect, nor someone to help.
And among His signs are ships in the sea, like mountains.
If He wills, He may stop the wind, so they will stand still on its back. Surely in this, there are signs for everyone who is ever patient, fully grateful.
Or He may destroy them because of what they earned, and may overlook many,
and (in such an event) those who raise disputes in Our verses will come to know that there is no way for them to escape.
So, whatever thing has been given to you is an enjoyment of the worldly life. And that which is with Allah is much better, and much more durable for those who believe and place their trust in Allah,
and (for) those who abstain from the major sins and from shameless acts; and (for those who) when they get angry, they forgive,
and those who have responded to their Lord (in submission to Him), and have established salah, and whose affairs are (settled) with consultation between them, and who spend out of what We have given to them,
and those who, when they are subjected to aggression, defend themselves.
And the recompense of evil is evil like it. Then the one who forgives and compromises has his reward undertaken by Allah. Surely, He does not like the unjust.
And the one who defends himself after having been wronged, there is no blame on such people.
Blame, in fact, is upon those who wrong people and make mischief on earth unjustly. For such people there is a painful punishment.
And if one observes patience and forgives, it is, of course, one of the courageous conducts.
And the one whom Allah lets go astray, there is no one for him to protect thereafter. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they will see the punishment, that they will say, "Is there any way to be sent back (to the world)?‚Äù
And you will see them being presented to it (the Fire), downcast because of humiliation, looking with stealthy glance. And those who believe will say, "The real losers are those who have lost their own selves and their families on the Day of Judgment." Be aware that the wrongdoers are in lasting punishment.
And for them there will not be any friends who may help them besides Allah. And the one whom Allah lets go astray, for him there is no way (to save himself).
Respond to your Lord before there comes a day for which there will be no reversal from Allah's side. For you there will be neither a refuge that day, nor an opportunity to question (Allah about your fate).
So, if they turn away, then We did not send you as a supervisor over them. You are not responsible but for conveying the message. And when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices with it, and if an evil befalls him because of what their hands sent ahead, then man becomes ungrateful.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He grants females to whom He wills, and grants males to whom He wills.
Or He combines for them couples, both males and females, and makes whom He wills barren. Surely, He is All-Knowing, Very-Powerful.
And it is not (possible) for a human being that Allah speaks to him, except by way of revelation, or from behind a curtain, or that He sends a messenger, then he reveals, with His permission, what He wills. Surely, He is High, Wise.
And in similar way, We have revealed to you a Spirit from Our command. You did not know earlier what is the Book or what is ` Iman' (true faith), but We have made it (the Qur'an) a light with which We guide whomsoever We will from among Our slaves. And indeed you are guiding (people) to a straight path,
the path of Allah, the One to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Be aware that towards Allah all matters shall finally return.
