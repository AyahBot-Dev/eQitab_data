I swear by the dawn,
and by the Ten Nights,
and by the even and the odd,
and by the night when it moves away,
Is there (not) in that an oath (enough) for a man of sense?
Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with (the people) of ` Ad

He will say, "0 Would that I had sent ahead (some good deeds) for (this) my life!"
So, that day, no one can punish as He will punish,
nor can anyone shackle like He will shackle.
(As for an obedient man, it will be said to him,) "0 content soul,
come back to your Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing.
So, enter among My (special) servants,
