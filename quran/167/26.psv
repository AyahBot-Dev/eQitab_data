Ta seen meem.
These are the verses of the manifest Book.
Seemingly you are going to let yourself collapse in grief because they do not believe.
If We so will, We can send down to them a sign from the sky before which their necks will stay bent in submission.
And there comes to them no new message from the Rahman, but they become averse to it.
Thus they rejected (the Truth); so soon will come to them the real descriptions of what they used to ridicule.
Have they not looked at the earth, how many of the noble pairs (of vegetation) We have caused to grow therein?
Surely, in this there is a sign, and most of them are not to believe
And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
And (remember) when your Lord called Musa saying, "Go to the transgressing people,
the people of Fir` aun (the Pharaoh). Do they not fear Allah?"
He (Musa) said, "My Lord, I fear they will belie me.
And my heart gets straitened and my tongue is not fluent; so send for Harun.
And they have (made) a charge of offence against me and I fear they will kill me;"
He (Allah) said, Never! So go, both of you, with Our signs. We are with you, listening.
So, the two of you reach the Fir` aun and say, 'We both are messengers of the Lord of all the worlds,
(sent with the message) that you must send the children of Isra it with us"
He (the Pharaoh) said, 'Did we not nourish you among us as a child? And you remained among us for years,
and you did that deed of yours which you did while you were among the ungrateful.
He said, "I did that at that time when I was one of the unaware people.
Then I fled from you when I feared you. Thereafter my Lord granted wisdom to me and made me among the messengers.
And this is the favor with which you are obliging me - that you have enslaved the children of Isra il."
The Pharaoh said, "And what is the Lord of the worlds?"
He (Musa) said, "Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever there is between them, if you are to believe"
He (the Pharaoh) said to those around him, "Are you not hearing?"
He (Musa) said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your early forefathers"
He (the Pharaoh) said, "Your messenger who is sent to you is a mad man indeed."
He (Musa) said, "Lord of the East and the West and whatever there is between them, if you are to understand"
He (the Pharaoh) said, "If you take to a God other than me, I will certainly put you among those imprisoned."
He (Musa) said "Will you (do this) even if I bring to you something evident?"
He said, "Then bring it, if you are one of the truthful."
So, he threw down his staff, and in no time it was a serpent, clearly visible,
and he drew out his hand, and right then it was a white light to the onlookers.
He (the Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him "This man is certainly an expert sorcerer".
He wants to expel you from your land with his sorcery. So what do you suggest?"
They said, "Leave him and his brother alone for a while and send to the cities men to collect,
so that they bring to you every highly expert sorcerer."
So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointed time of a known day,
and it was said to the people, "Would you assemble,
so that we may follow the sorcerers if they are victorious?"
So, when the sorcerers came, they said to the Pharaoh, "Will there really be a reward for us, if we are the victorious?"
He said, "Yes, and of course, you will then be among the closer ones."
] Musa said to them, 'Throw you down what you are to throw."
So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and said, 'By the majesty of the Pharaoh we are going to Prevail definitely."
Then Musa threw down his staff, and in no time it started swallowing the falsehood they invented.
So the sorcerers were made (by the truth they saw) to fall down in prostration.
They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
the Lord of Musa and Harun."
He (the Pharaoh) said, "you believed in him before I permit you. Surely, he (Musa) is the chief of you all who has taught you sorcery. So you will soon know (your fate). I will cut off your hands and feet from different sides and will crucify you all together.
They said, 'There is no harm. We are to return to our Lord.
We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our faults, as we are the first of the believers."
And We revealed to Musa saying, "Make My slaves travel at night. You will be pursued."
So the Pharaoh sent into the cities (his) men to muster (people)
saying, "These are a small band,
] and indeed they are enraging us,
] and we are a host, well-armed."
So We expelled them from gardens and springs
and from treasures and a noble abode.
Thus it was. And We made the children of Isra'il inherit all these.
So they (the people of the Pharaoh) pursued them (the people of 1VVlusa) at the time of sunrise.
And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa said, "Surely we are overtaken."
He said, "Never! Indeed with me is my Lord. He will guide me."
So We revealed to Musa saying, "Strike the sea with your staff." So it was severed apart, and each part became like a big mountain.
Then We brought others close to that place.
And We saved Musa and all those with him.
Then we drowned the others.
Surely, in this there is a sign, and most of them are not to believe.
And your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
And recite before them the narrative of Ibrahim,
when he said to his father and to his people, "What do you worship?"
They said, "We worship idols, and stay devoted to them."
He said, "Do they listen to you when you call
(them) or do-they bring benefit to you or harm
?" They said, No, but we have found our fathers doing like this."
He said, "Have you then ever considered what you have been worshipping,
you and your ancient fathers,
they all are an enemy to me, except the Lord of the worlds,
Who created me, then guides me,
and Who feeds me and gives me drink,
and when I become sick, He heals me,
and who will make me die, then will give me life,
and who, I hope, will forgive my fault on the Day of Retribution.
0 my Lord, give me wisdom and join me with the righteous,
and destine for me a truthful description among the next generations.
And make me among those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,
and forgive my father. Indeed he was among those who went astray.
And do not put me to disgrace on the Day when all will be raised to life,
the Day when neither wealth will be of any use (to any one) nor sons,
except to one who will come to Allah with a sound heart,
and the Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing
and the Hell will be fully uncovered for the perverse,
and it will be said to them, 'Where is that which you used to worship
beside Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?'
So they (their false gods) will be thrown on their faces into it - they and the erring people
and the entire army of Iblis, all together.
They will say when they will be quarreling with each other,
°By Allah, we were in open error
when we used to equate you with the Lord of the worlds,
] and none misguided us except the sinners.
Now we have neither any intercessors
nor any true friend.
Would that we have a chance to return whereby we become among the believers'!"
Surely, in this there is a sign,
and most of them are not to believe. And your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
And the people of Lut belied the messengers
when their brother Nuh said to them, 'Do you not fear Allah?
I am an honest messenger for you.
So, fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds;
so, fear Allah and obey me."
They said, "Shall we believe in you while you are followed by the lowest people?"
He said, "I do not know about what they do;
their account is with none but with my Lord, if you have sense.
And I am not to drive the believers away;
I am not but a plain warner."
They said, "Should you not stop, 0 Nuh, you will surely be among those stoned."
He said, "My Lord, my people have belied me.
So judge between me and them with an open verdict and save me and all the believers who are with me."
'So We saved him and those with him in the Ark that was fully occupied.
Then We drowned, after that, all the remaining.
Surely in this there is a sign, and most of them are not to believe.
And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
The (people of) ` Ad belied the messengers
when their brother Hud said to them, "Do you not fear Allah?
I am an honest messenger for you,
so fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.
Do you erect on every height a sign, having no sound purpose,
and take the objects of architecture as if you are going to live forever,
and when you seize (someone) you seize as tyrants?
So fear Allah and obey me.
And fear the One who has supported you with what you know.
lie has supported you with cattle and sons,
and with gardens and springs.
In fact I fear for you the punishment of a great day."
They said, "It is all equal for us, whether you give us advice or you are not among those who give advice.
This is nothing but the practice of the ancient,
and we are not going to be punished."
Thus they belied him, so We destroyed them. Surely, in this there is a sign, and most of them are not to believe.
And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
The (people of) Thamud belied the messengers
when their brother Salih said to them, 'Do you not fear Allah?
I am an honest messenger for you.
So, fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.
Will you be left secure in whatever is here,
in gardens and springs,
and in farms and date-palms, the spates of which are interwoven?
1481 And you hew out houses from the hills with pride.
So fear Allah and obey me,
and do not obey the order of the transgressors
make mischief on the land and who do not set things right".
They said, "You are merely one of those bewitched.
You are nothing but a human like us. So, bring a sign if you are one of the truthful."
He said, "This is a she-camel - She has a share of water, and you have a share of water on a specified day.
So do not touch her with evil (intent), lest you should be seized by a painful punishment."
But they killed her, then they became remorseful and the punishment seized them.
Surely in this there is a sign, and most of them are not to believe.
And surely, your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
The people of Lut (علیہ السلام) belied the messengers
when their brother Lut (علیہ السلام) said to them, "Do you not fear Allah?
I am an honest messenger for you.

And I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.
Do you go to the males (for having sex) out of the whole universe,
and leave what your Lord has created for you, that is, your wives? in fact, you are a people who cross (all) limits."
They said, "If you do not stop 0 Lut, you shall be included among the outcast."
He said "Certainly, I am hateful to your act.
0 my Lord, save me and my family from what they do."
So We saved him and his family, all of them
except an old woman among those who remained behind.
Then We destroyed the others,
and subjected them to a terrible rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned.
Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not to believe.
And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
The people of Aykah belied the messengers
when Shu'aib said to them, 'Do you not fear Allah?
I am an honest messenger for you.
So fear Allah and obey me.

Give full measure and do not be among those who bring loss to others.
And weigh with an even balance.
And do not make people short of their things and do not spread disorder in the land as mischief makers.
And be fearful of the One who created you and the former generations."
They said, "You are but one of the bewitched men.
And you are no more than a human like us, and in fact we consider you to be one of the liars.
So cause a piece from the sky to fall down upon us, if you are one of the truthful."
He said, 'My Lord knows best what you do."
Thus they belied him, so they were seized by the torment of the Day of Canopy. Indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day.
Surely in this there is a sign, but most of them are not to believe.
Add surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.
And this (Qur'an) is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds.
It is brought by the Trusted Spirit down
to your heart, so that you become one of the warners
in plain Arabic language.
And of course, it is (mentioned) in the scriptures of the former people.
Is it not a proof for them that the knowledgeable of the children of Isra'il recognize him (the prophet)?
And (even) if We had revealed it to a non-Arab,
and he would have recited it to them, they were not to believe in it.
Thus We have made it enter into the hearts of the sinners.
They will not believe in it until they will see the painful punishment
and it will come to them suddenly while they will not be anticipating (it),
and they will say, "Is it (possible) that we are given some respite?"
Are they asking then that Our punishment should come soon?
So tell me, If We give them enjoyment for years,
then comes to them what they are warned of,
what help can be provided to them by the things thy were given to enjoy?
And We did not destroy any town unless it has had warners
to give advice, and We have never been unjust.
And this (Qur'an) is not brought down by the Shaitans.
It neither fits them, nor are they able to (do this).
In fact they are kept far from hearing (it at the time of revelation).
So do not invoke any other god along with Allah, or you will be among those who are to be punished.
And warn the nearest people of your clan,
and be kind with humbleness to the believers who followed you.
So if they disobey you, then say, "I disown what you do,"
and place your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,
Who sees you when you stand
(in prayer) and (sees) your movement among those who prostrate.
Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
Shall I tell you on whom the Shaitans descend?
They descend on every sinful liar.
They give ear to hear (secretly) and most of them tell lies.
As for the poets, they are followed by the straying people.
Did you not see that they wander in every valley
and that they say what they do not do,
except those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah very much and defend themselves after they are wronged. And the wrongdoers will soon know to which place they are going to return.
