Alif, Lim, Ra. (This is) a book the verses of which have been made firm, then elaborated by a Being All Wise, All Aware,
(with an order) that you worship none but Allah - surely, I am for you a warner from Him, and a bearer of glad tidings
and that you seek forgiveness from your Lord, then, turn to Him in repentance. He shall, then, provide you with good things to enjoy for a given time, and bestow His added grace on everyone of excellence. And if you turn away, then, I fear for you the punishment of a great day.
To Allah is your re-turn and He is powerful over everything.
Beware, they bend their chests to hide from Him. Beware, when they make their clothes a cover, He knows what they hide and what they expose. Surely, He is All Aware of what lies in the hearts.
And there is no creature on earth whose sustenance is not on Allah. And He knows its permanent and its temporary place. Everything is in a clear book.
And He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His throne was on water so that He might test you as to who among you is better in deed. And if you say, "you shall be raised after death," the disbelievers will surely say, "This is nothing but sheer magic."
And if We defer the punishment for them for a certain time, they shall say, "What is holding it back?" Beware, the day it visits them, it shall not be turned back from them and they shall be besieged by what they used to ridicule.
And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then take it away from him, he is then utterly desperate, ungrateful.
And if We give him a taste of comfort after he has suffered from some hardship, he shall say, "Evils have gone away from me." He is, then, over-exulting, arrogant,
except those who are patient and do good deeds. Those are the people for whom there is forgive-ness and a great reward.
It is then expected of you that you will abandon some of what is being revealed to you and that your heart will be straitened thereby, because they say, "Why has a treasure not been sent down to him or an angel not come with him?" You are but a warner. And Allah takes care of everything.
What? Do they say that he has fabricated it? Say, "Then bring ten surahs like it, fabricated. And call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if you are true."
So, if they do not respond to you, then be sure that it has been sent down with the knowledge of Allah and that there is no god but He. So, do you submit?
Those who have been intending (to achieve) the worldly life and its beauty, We shall fully recompense them herein for their acts, and herein they shall not be given less.
Those are the people for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except fire. And nullified is what they have worked herein and void is what they have been doing.
So, what about the one who is on a clear path, and there comes after it evidence from within and, before it, the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? Such people believe in it. And whoever of the groups disbelieves it, then, Fire is his promised place. So, do not be in doubt about it. Surely, it is the truth from your Lord but most of people do not believe.
And who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah? They shall be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord. Beware, the curse of Allah lies on the unjust,
those who prevent (people) he way of Allah and seek crookedness in it. They, surely they, are disbelievers of the Hereafter."
They were unable to frustrate (Allah's plan) on the earth, and there were no supporters for them besides Allah. Multiplied for them shall be the punishment. They were not able to hear, nor would they see.
Those are the ones who brought loss to their own selves, and lost for them was all that they used to fabricate.
Invariably, they are the worst losers in the Hereafter.
Surely, those who believe and do good deeds and humble their selves before their Lord - those are the people of Paradise. There they shall live forever.
The example of the two groups is like the one blind and deaf and the one seeing and hearing. Are the two equal when compared? Would you still pay no heed?
And We have sent Nuh to his people (saying to them): "I am, for you, a clear warner,
that you worship none but Allah, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day."
So, the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, said, "We see (that) you are nothing but a man like us. And we do not see you followed by anyone but by the lowest among us who are of shallow opinion, and we do not see in you any superiority over us; rather, think you are liars.
He said, "0 my people, tell me when I am on a clear path from my Lord, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself and it has been hidden from your sight. Shall we, then, impose it upon you while you are averse to it?
And, 0 my people, I do not demand from you any wealth for it. My reward is with none but Allah. And I am not to drive the believers away. Surely, they are to meet their Lord, but I see that you are an ignorant people.
And, 0 my people, who will help me against (the punishment of) Allah, if I drive them away? Would you still pay no heed?
And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I have the knowledge of the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. And I do not say about those who are contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never award them any good; Allah is the best- knower of what is in their hearts. (If I do so) then, I shall indeed be one of the unjust."
They said, "0 Nuh, you have quarreled with us, and quarreled much. Now bring what you threaten us with, if you are one of the truthful."
He said, "Only Allah will bring it to you, if He so wills, and you cannot frustrate (His will).
And my good counsel will not profit you, even though I wish you the best, if Allah wills to make you go astray. He is your Lord and to Him you shall be made to return."
Do they still say that he has forged it? Say, "If I have forged it, then, upon me is my sin, and I am free of the sins you commit."
And it was revealed to Nuh that none of your people would ever believe except those who have already believed: "So, be not distressed by what they have been doing.
And make an ark under Our eyes and ac-cording to Our revelation. And do not speak to Me about those who crossed the limits - they are to be drowned."
And he started making the Ark. And whenever the chieftains of his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, "If you mock at us, we mock at you like you mock at us:
So, you shall soon know to whom will come the punishment that will humiliate him and upon whom will befall a lasting punishment."
At last when Our command came and the oven over-flowed. We said, "Load in it a pair of two from every kind along with your family - except those against whom the Word has already been spoken - and those who have believed." And there were only a few who had believed with him.
And he said, "Embark it. With the name of Allah it sails and anchors. Surely, my Lord is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful."
And it was sailing with them amidst the waves like mountains. And Nuh called out to his son, who was at an isolated place, "0 my child, come on board with us, and do not be in the company of the disbelievers."
He said, "I shall take shelter on a mountain which will save me from the water." He said, "There is no saver to-day from the command of Allah, except the one to whom He shows mercy." And the waves rose high between the two, and he was among the drowned.
And it was said, "0 earth, suck in your water, and 0 heaven, stop." And water subsided, and the matter was over. And it (the Ark) came to rest on the Judiyy, and it was said, "Curse be upon the wrongdoers."
And Nuh called unto his Lord and said, "My Lord, my son is a part of my family, and surely, Your promise is true, and You are the greatest of all judges."
He said, "0 Nuh, surely, he is not a part of your family. In-deed, he is (a man of) bad deeds. So do not ask Me something of which you have no knowledge. I counsel you not to be among the ignorant.
He said, "My Lord, I seek refuge with You against that I ask You something of which I have no knowledge. And if You do not forgive me and do not show mercy to me, I shall be among the losers."
It was said, "0 Nuh, disembark in peace from Us and with blessings upon you and upon the peoples (springing) from those with you. And there are peoples whom We shall give some enjoyment, then a painful punishment from Us will visit them."
These are some reports from the unseen (events) which We reveal to you. You did not know them before this, neither you nor your people. So, be patient. Surely, the end is in favor of the God-fearing.
And to ` Ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said, "0 my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You are nothing but fabricators.
0 my people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward is only on the One who created me. Have you, then, no sense?
And O my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn to Him in repentance, so that He may release the heavens pouring upon you and may increase you in strength beside your strength, and do not turn away like sinners."
They said, "0 Hud, you did not bring to us any proof, and we are not to leave our gods on your statement, and we are not to believe in you.
We do not say except that some of our gods have subjected you to some evil." He said, "I make Allah my witness, and you be witness that I have nothing to do with what you take as gods besides Him.
So, try your plans against me, all of you together, then give me no respite.
I place my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but He takes it by the forelock. Surely, my Lord is on a straight path.
Now, if you turn away, I have already conveyed to you what I was sent to you with. And my Lord will replace you with some other people, and you cannot do Him any harm. Surely, my Lord is guardian over everything."
And when came Our command, We saved Hud and those who believed along with him, out of mercy from Us, and We did save them from a heavy punishment.
That was the tribe of ` Ad who rejected the signs of their Lord, disobeyed their Messengers and followed the dictates of every obstinate tyrant!
And a curse was made to pursue them in this world and on the Day of Doom. Lo! The people of ` Ad disbelieved their Lord. Lo! Curse be upon ` Ad, the people of Hud.
And to (the people on Thamud (We sent) their brother, Salih. He said, "0 my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He has created you from earth and made you settle therein. So, seek His forgiveness, then turn to Him in repentance. Surely, my Lord is near, responding."
They said, "0 Salih, we had hopes in you before this. Do you ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped? And we are certainly in confounding doubt about what you are calling us to."
He said, "0 my people, tell me: When I am on a clear path, and He has bestowed mercy upon me from Himself, who will then come to my help against Allah, if I disobey Him? So, you add on to me nothing but a loss.
And 0 my people, this is the she-camel of Allah, a sign for you. So, leave her free to eat in the land of Allah and do not even touch her with evil (intention), lest a near punishment should seize you."
Then they slaughtered her. So, he said, "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days (only). That is a promise, not going to be false."
So, when came Our command, We saved Salih and those who believed along with Him, out of mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day. Surely, your Lord is the Powerful, the All Mighty.
And those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found dead in their homes, fallen on their knees,
as though they had never lived there. Lo! The people of Thamud disbelieved their Lord. Lo! Curse be upon the people of Thamud
And Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good news. They said, "Sal-am (peace)." He said, "Sal-am." Then he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf.
So, when he noticed their hands not reaching for it, he found them strange and felt a bit of fright from them. They said, "Be not frightened. We have been sent to the people of Lit."
And his wife was standing (nearby). She laughed, so, We gave her the good news about Ishaq, and about Ya` qub after Ishaq.
She said, "Woe is to me! Shall I give birth to a child while I am an old woman and this is my husband, an old man? This is something strange, indeed."
They said, "Do you marvel at Allah's command? Allah's mercy and His blessings are upon you, the people of the house. Surely, He is praiseworthy, glorious."
So, when fear left Ibrahim and the happy news came to him, he started pleading before Us for the people of Lut.
Surely, Ibrahim is forbearing, very penitent, ever-turning to Allah.
0 Ibrahim! Leave it, in fact, the command of your Lord has come, and there has to come upon them a punishment, not to be turned back.
And when Our emissaries (angels) came to Lut, he felt uneasy and was strained in his heart on account of them, and said, "This is a very hard day."
And his people came to him, rushing upon him. And already they used to commit evil deeds. He said, "These are my daughters. They are far more clean for you. So, fear Allah and do not disgrace me in respect of my guests. Is there not a single right man among you."
They said, "You know that we have no claim on your daughters, and you know well what we want."
He said, "0 that I had power over you or might have some strong support for refuge."
They (the angels) said, "0 Lut, we are emissaries of your Lord. They shall never reach you. So, move with your family in a part of night, and none of you shall turn to look back; except your woman. There has to befall her whatever befalls them. Their deadline is the morning. Is it not that the morning is near?"
So, when Our command came, We turned its highest into the lowest, and We rained on it stones of hard clay, one over another
marked, with your Lord. And it is not far from the transgressors.
And to Madyan (We sent) their brother, Shu'aib. He said, "0 my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not lessen the measure and the weight. I see you quite well off, and I fear for you the punishment of an encircling day.
And 0 my people, perfect the measure and the balance with justice and do not make the people short of their things, and do not go about the earth spreading disorder.
Whatever is left (with you) by Allah is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a watchman over you.
They said, "0 Shu'aib, does your galah (prayer) command you that we should give up what our fathers used to worship or give up our free-will in (spending) our wealth? You are provenly the man of wisdom and guidance."
He said, "0 my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path from my Lord and He has provided me from Himself with a good provision, (should I still leave you unguided?) And I do not want to do in your absence what I prohibit for you. I want nothing but to set things right as far as I can. .And my ability to do things comes from none but Allah. In Him alone I have placed my trust and to Him alone I turn in humbleness.
0 my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you to suffer what was suffered by the people of Nuh, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih. And the people of Lut are not far from you.
And seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn towards Him in repentance. Surely, my Lord is very merciful, most loving."
They said, "0 Shu'aib, we do not understand most of what you say, and, in fact, we see you weak among us. But for your clan, we would have stoned you. And to us, you are not a man of respect."
He said, "0 my people, is my clan more respectable to you than Allah? And you have taken Him as something thrown behind your backs. Surely, my Lord encompasses all that you do.
And 0 my people, do what you can, I am to do (what I can). Soon you will know the one whom the punishment visits humiliating him, and the one who is false. And wait. I am, with you, waiting."
And when Our command came, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed along with him, out of mercy from Us, and those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found (dead) in the homes, fallen on their knees,
as though they never lived there. Lo! Curse be upon Madyan, like Thamud were cursed.
And We sent Musa with Our signs, and with clear proof,
to Pharaoh and his group. So, they followed the command of Pharaoh. And the command of Pharaoh is not right.
He will lead his people on the Day of Judgment, and make them descend into the Fire. And it is the evil descending place.
And the curse was made to pursue them here and on the Day of Judgment. It is the evil reward to be offered.
That is a part of stories of the towns that We narrate to you. Some of them are standing, and (some) harvested.
And We have not wronged them; rather, they have wronged themselves. So, their gods whom they used to invoke beside Allah did not come to their help in anything, when came the command of your Lord, and they gave them nothing more than destruction.
And such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the (people of) towns while they are transgressing. Indeed, His seizing is painful, severe.
In this there is a sign for the one who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day when all the people shall be gathered together, and that is a day having everyone present.
And We do not defer it but for a limited term,
the day it comes no one shall speak except by His leave. So, some of them are wretched and (some) blessed.
As for those who are wretched, they shall be in the Fire. For them there is (nothing but) crying and howling.
They shall remain there for ever, as long as the heavens and the earth remain, unless your Lord wills (otherwise). Surely, your Lord does what He in-tends.
As for those who are blessed, they shall be in Paradise living there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth remain, unless your Lord wills (otherwise) an award never to be cut off.
So, be not in doubt about what they worship. They do not worship except in the way their fathers used to worship earlier. And surely, We are going to pay them their full share, non-curtailed.
And We gave Musa the Book, then it was disputed about. But, for a word from your Lord that had already come, the matter would have been decided between them. And surely, they are in confounding doubt about it.
And to all of them, your Lord shall pay for their deeds in full. Surely, He is aware of all that they do.
So, stand firm - as you have been commanded - you, and those who have repented with you, and do not cross the limits. Surely, He is watchful of what you do.
And do not incline towards the wrongdoers, lest the Fire should catch you, and you shall have no supporters other than Allah, then you shall not be helped.
And establish Salah at both ends of the day, and in the early hours of the night. Surely, good deeds erase bad deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.
And be patient, for Allah lets not the reward of the good-doers be lost.
Then, why is it that there was none, among the generations before you, having some remnants (of wisdom) to stop people from creating disorder in the land, except a few among them whom We saved? And the wrongdoers pursued the luxuries they were involved in, and they became sinners.
And your Lord is not such that He would destroy the towns unjustly while their people are good in their ways.
Had your Lord willed, He would have made all the people a single community. But, they will continue in their differences,
except those whom Allah has blessed with mercy. And for that He has created them. And perfect is the word of your Lord: "I will surely fill the hell with Jinns and the human beings, all together."
And We narrate to you everything from the events of the messengers with which We strengthen your heart. And herein there has come to you the truth, a good counsel and a reminder to those who believe.
Say to those who do not believe, "Do whatever you can. We are doing (what we can).
And wait. We are waiting."
And to Allah belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and to Him the whole matter shall be returned. So worship Him and have trust in Him. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do.
