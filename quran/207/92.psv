By night as it envelops [everything with darkness],
and daylight when things seem radiant,
and whatever has created the male and the female,
your effort has been too diffuse.
For anyone who gives [generously], performs his duty
and acts charitably in the finest manner
We shall facilitate an easy way for him;
while anyone who acts miserably, and feels he is self-sufficient
and rejects the finest [things in life]
We shall make it easy for him (to go] the hard way.
His money will not help him out as he stumbles along.
Guidance is Our concern:
to Us belongs the Hereafter and the very First [of life];
so I have warned you (all) about a raging fire.
Only the most wretched will roast in it,
the one who rejects [the Message] and turns away;
while the most heedful will keep away from it,
the one who gives his money away and (thereby) purifies himself
No one is awarded any favor by him [in return]
except through seeking the countenance of his Lord, the All-Highest.
[Such a man] shall be pleased [when entered Paradise].
