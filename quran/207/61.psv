Whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth glorifies Allah (God). He is the Powerful, the Wise!
You who believe, why do you preach something you are not practising?
Allah (God) feels a strong distaste for you to preach something you do not practise.
Allah (God) loves those who fight for His sake in [battle] ranks as if they were a solid structure.
Thus Moses told his folk: "My folk, why do you annoy me? You know I am Allah (God)'s messenger to you." When they wavered, Allah (God) let their hearts waver too; Allah (God) does not guide immoral folk.
So Jesus the son of Mary said: "Children of Israel, I am Allah (God)'s messenger to you, confirming whatever came before me in the Torah and announcing a messenger coming after me whose name will be Ahmad." Yet when he brought them explanations, they said: "This is sheer magic!"
Who is more in the wrong than someone who invents a lie about Allah (God) while he is being invited to [embrace] Islam? Allah (God) does not guide such wrongdoing folk.
They want to blow Allah (God)'s light out with their mouths while He is Perfecting His light no matter how disbelievers may dislike it.
He is the One Who has sent His messenger with guidance and the True Religion, so He will have it prevail over every other religion no matter how those who associate [others with Allah (God)] may hate it. (ii)
You who believe, shall I lead you to a bargain that will save you from painful torment?
You should believe in Allah (God) and His messenger, and strive in Allah (God)'s way with your property and your persons; that will be better for you if you only knew.
He will forgive you your offences and show you into gardens through which rivers flow, and wholesome dwellings in the gardens of Eden. That will be the supreme Achievement!
And something else you will love to have: support from Allah (God) and a victory close at hand. Proclaim such to believers!
You who believe, act as Allah (God)'s supporters just as Jesus the son of Mary told the disciples: "Who will be my supporters [along the way] towards Allah (God)?" The disciples said: "We are Allah (God)'s supporters." A faction from the Children of Israel believed, while another faction disbelieved. We assisted the ones who believed against their enemy, till they held the upper hand.
