T. S. These are verses from the Quran and [it is] a clear Book
[offered] for guidance and as good news for believers
who keep up prayer and pay the Zakat (welfare tax) while they feel certain about the Hereafter.
We have made those who do not believe in the Hereafter feel their actions are attractive even though they are (really) groping around.
Those are the ones who will have the worst torment, while they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.
Yet you have been proffered the Quran by Someone [Who is] Wise, All- Knowing.
Thus Moses told his household: "I've glimpsed a fire. I'll bring you some news from it, or I'll bring you a glowing ember so that you may warm yourselves."
When he came up to it, [a voice] called out: "Blessed be Whoever is in the Fire, and whoever stands around it! Glory be to Allah (God), Lord of the Universe!
O Moses, I am Allah (God), the Powerful, the Wise.
Throw down your staff!" When he saw it wriggling as if it were possessed, he turned his back on it and tried to run away. '"Moses, do not fear. Emissaries do not fear in My presence
except for someone who has done wrong. Then, should he change to something finer after [committing] evil, I will be Forgiving, Merciful,
Put your hand into your shirtfront; it will come out [shinning] white without [causing any] evil. There will be nine signs for Pharaoh and folk. They have been such immoral people."
When Our signs came to them so plain to see, they said: "This is sheer magic!"
They repudiated them wrongfully and haughtily though they themselves felt certain about it. See how the outcome was for mischief makers.
We gave David and Solomon knowledge, and they both said: "Praise be to Allah (God), Who has made us excel over many of His believing servants."
Solomon fell heir to David, and he said: "O mankind, we have been taught the speech of birds, and been given [a little] of everything. This is manifest bounty."
His armies of sprites, men and birds were drawn up before Solomon; they paraded forth
until, when they came to the Valley of the Ants, an ant said: "O ants, enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you without even noticing it."
So he smiled, laughing at its statement, and said: "My Lord, arrange things for me so I shall act grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and so I may act so honorably that You will approve of it. Admit me through Your mercy among Your honorable servants.
He inspected the birds, and said: "What's wrong with me that I do not see the hoopoe? Or could it be absent?
I shall punish it severely or slaughter it, unless it brings me some clear authority."
It was not long in coming, and said: "I have just acquired some information you have not picked up, for I bring you reliable news from Sheba.
I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given everything and has a splendid throne.
I found both her and her people bowing down on their knees to the sun instead of to Allah (God) [Alone]. Satan has made their actions seem attractive to them, and diverted them from the [proper] Way. They are not guided
so they do not bow down on their knees before Allah (God), Who brings forth what is concealed in Heaven and Earth, and knows anything you hide as well as anything you display.
Allah (God), there is no deity except Him, Lord of the splendid Throne!
He said: "We shall see whether you have been truthful or are a liar.
Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them, and see what [answer] they send back."
She said: "Councilmen, an important letter has been delivered to me.
It is from Solomon and it (reads]: "In the name of Allah (God), the Mercy-giving, the Merciful!
Do not act haughtily towards me, and come to me committed to [live at] peace [submitting to Allah (God)]."
She said: "Councilmen, give me your opinion concerning my affair: I have never settled any matter unless you were present with me."
They said: "We possess strength and can be extremely violent, while authority rests with you; so attend to whatever you will command."
She said: 'Whenever any kings enter a town and plunder it, they turn the most important men among its people into the lowest. Thus they act.
I am sending them a gift and shall be watching for whatever the emissaries bring back."
When it reached Solomon, he said; "Will you furnish me with wealth? What Allah (God) has given me is better than what He has given you; nevertheless you seem quite happy with your gift.
Go back to them, for We shall come to them with armies they can never resist. We shall expel them from it just like the meanest people, and they will be humiliated."
He said: "Councilman, which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"
An imp among the sprites said: 'I'll bring it to you before you even rise up from your place. I am strong enough to be entrusted with it."
Someone who had some knowledge about the Book [Scripture] said; 'I shall bring you it in the twinkling of an eye!" When he saw it set before him, he said: "This is some of my Lord's bounty, so He may test me whether I am thankful or thankless. Anyone who is thankful gives thanks only on his own behalf, while with anyone who is thankless, well my Lord is Transcendent, Generous,"
He said: "Disguise her throne for her; let us see whether she is guided or is one of those who are not guided."
When she came, someone said: "Is your throne like this?" She said: "It seems to be similar." (We were given knowledge before she was, and have become Muslims.
What she had been worshipping instead of Allah (God) distracted her; she belonged to disbelieving folk.
Someone [else] said to her: "Enter the hall." When she saw it, she thought it was a pool [of water] and [tucked up her skirt and) bared the calves of her legs. He said: "It is a hall paved with glass slabs." She said: "My Lord, how I have wronged myself! I submit myself peacefully, along with Solomon, to Allah (God), Lord of the Universe!"
We sent Thamud their brother Salih: [who said]: "Worship Allah (God) [Alone]!" Nonetheless they became two quarreling factions.
He said: "My people, why do you hasten towards evil rather than something fine? If you only sought forgiveness from Allah (God), you might find mercy."
They said: "Shall we take it as an omen from you and from someone who is with you?" He said; "Your fate depends on Allah (God); in fact, you are a folk who will be tested."
There was a gang of nine persons in the city who caused trouble on earth and never improved matters.
They said: "Let's all swear by Allah (God) that we shall catch him and his family some night. Then we shall tell his next of kin: 'We did not witness the slaughter of his family. We are telling the truth!"'
They plotted away while We plotted too, and they did not even notice it.
See what was the outcome of their plotting! We annihilated them and their folk completely!
Those used to be their houses - [now] empty because of the wrong they had committed! In that is a sign for folk who know.
We saved the ones who believed and had been doing their duty.
When Lot told his folk: 'Do you indulge in sexual misconduct with your eyes open?"
Do you approach men passionately instead of women? Indeed you are folk who act out of ignorance!"
His folk's answer was merely to say: "Run Lot's family out of your town; they are people who try to keep clean!"
So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be one of those who stayed behind.
We sent a rain down upon them; how evil was such rain for those who had been warned!
SAY: "Praise be to Allah (God), and peace on those servants of His whom He has selected. Is Allah (God) Better, or whatever they associate [with Him]?.
"Who created Heaven and Earth and has sent down water from the sky for you, so We have caused lovely gardens to grow by means of it? You have no other way to make their trees grow." Is there any (other) deity alongside Allah (God)? Rather they are people who dodge the facts.
Who set the earth up as a residence, laced it with rivers and planted mountains on it, and laid an isthmus between both seas? Is there any (other) deity alongside Allah (God)? Rather most of them do not know.
Who answers the distressed man when he appeals to Him, and removes evil, and makes you overlords on earth? Is there any deity alongside Allah (God)? How seldom do you reflect [on this]!
Who guides you through darkness on land and at sea, and Who sends out winds as heralds for His mercy? Is there any deity alongside Allah (God)? Exalted is Allah (God) over anything they may associate [with Him]!
Who begins with creation, then performs it all over again? Who provides for you from Heaven and Earth? Is there any deity alongside Allah (God)? SAY: "Bring on your proof if you have been so truthful!"
SAY: "No one in Heaven or Earth knows the Unseen except Allah (God)!" They do not even realize when they will be raised up again;
nor does their knowledge grasp the Hereafter. Rather they are in doubt about it indeed they are blind concerning it!
Those who disbelieve say: "When we and our forefathers have become dust, shall we be brought forth again?
We and our forefathers were promised this before; these are only legends [made up] by primitive men."
SAY: "Travel around the earth and see what the outcome for criminals was like."
Do not worry about them nor feel any anxiety over whatever they are plotting.
They are saying: "When will this promise be, if you are so truthful?"
SAY: "Perhaps part of what you are try to hurry up will catch you from behind!"
Your Lord possesses bounty for mankind, although most of them are not thankful;
yet your Lord does know anything your breasts conceal as well as anything they display.
There is nothing elsewhere in either Heaven or Earth unless it appears in a plain Record.
This Quran tells the Children of Israel most of what they have been differing over;
it serves as guidance and a mercy for believers.
Your Lord will judge between them through His discretion; He is the Powerful, the Aware!
So rely on Allah (God), since you hold manifest Truth.
You cannot make the dead hear [the truth], nor even the deaf hear the Appeal once they turn around to escape.
You are no one to guide the blind out of their misguidance; you will only cause someone who believes in Our signs to listen, for they are submitting to [Allah (God)].
Whenever the Sentence prevails against them, We shall bring forth a monster from the earth for them who will speak to them, because mankind has not been convinced by Our signs.
Some day We shall summon a troop from every nation which has rejected Our signs, and they will be paraded forth
until, when they come [before Allah (God)], He will say: "Did you reject My signs and not grasp any knowledge concerning them? What have you been doing?"
The Sentence will prevail against them because of the wrong they have committed. They will not utter [a word].
Have they not considered how We have made night so they may rest in it, and daylight so they can see? In that are signs for folk who believe.
Some day the Trumpet will be blown and startle whoever is in Heaven and whoever is on Earth, except for anyone Allah (God) may wish. Everyone will come to Him abjectly.
You will see the mountains, which you thought were solid, slip away just as clouds slip away, through the handiwork of Allah (God) Who consummates everything. He is Informed about whatever you are doing.
Anyone who comes with a fine deed will have something better than it and they will be safe from that day's terror;
while anyone who comes with an evil deed will be flung face down into the Fire: "Aren’t you rewarded with just what you've been doing?"
I have only been ordered to serve the Lord of this city [Mecca] which He has hallowed. He possesses everything. I have been ordered to be a Muslim,
and to recite the Quran. Anyone who is guided, will be guided only for his own sake, while tell anyone who strays away: 'I am merely a warner."
SAY: "Praise be to Allah (God)! He will show you His signs so you may recognize them. Your Lord is not overlooking anything you do!" 28. Stories
