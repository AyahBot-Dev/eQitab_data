By the sky and the Nightcomer!
What will make you realize what the Nightcomer is?
The star shining [before dawn]!
Each soul has a guardian [set up] over it,
so let everyman notice what he has been created from.
He was created from a fluid ejected
from between his backbone and his ribs.
He is Able to revive him
on a day when secrets will be tested;
so he will have no strength [left] nor any supporter.
By the sky with its cycle,
by the earth cracking open,
it is a decisive statement!
It is no joke.
They are hatching some plot
while I too am hatching a plot;
so put up with disbelievers; put up with them as long as you can!
