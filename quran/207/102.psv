Competition has distracted you
until you visit graveyards.
Nevertheless you soon will know;
once more, you soon shall know!
Of course, if you realized with absolute certainty
how you will (all) see Hades,
then you would see it with the [very] eye of certainty;
next you will be questioned concerning bliss [in the worldly life] on that day.
