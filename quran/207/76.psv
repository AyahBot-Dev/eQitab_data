Has a period in [this] age not come over (every) man when he was nothing worth mentioning?
We have created man from a drop of semen [forming] cells so We might test him; thus We made him alert, observant.
We have guided him along the [right] path, whether he is thankful or thankless.
We have prepared chains, shackles and a Blaze for disbelievers!
The virtuous will drink from a cup which will be mixed with camphor,
a freely gushing spring where Allah (God)'s servants will drink.
They [always] keep their word, and fear a day whose evil tends to spread around.
They offer food to the needy, the orphan and the captive out of love for Him:
"We are only feeding you for Allah (God)'s sake. We want no reward from you nor any thanks.
We fear a gloomy, dismal day from our Lord."
Allah (God) will shield them from that day's evil, and procure them splendor and happiness.
Their compensation for being patient will be a garden and silk (clothing],
relaxing on couches there where they will see neither sun nor any frost.
Close over them will hang its awnings, while its clusters of fruit will droop low.
Silver pitchers will be passed around them, and glasses made from crystal,
crystal [set] with silver, which they will measure out just as they please,
and be allowed to drink from them a cup flavored with ginger,
[from] a spring there that is called Salsabil (like a Nectar).
Immortal youths will stroll around them; whenever you see them, you will think they are scattered pearls.
Wherever you look, you will see bliss and vast control.
They will wear clothing made from green brocade and cloth of gold, and will be dressed up with silver bracelets, while their Lord will offer them a pure drink:
"This is your reward, and your effort has been appreciated."
It is We Who have sent the Quran down to you as a revelation
so be patient concerning your Lord's decision and do not obey any wicked or ungrateful person among them.
Remember your Lord's name both in the early morning and late afternoon,
and during the night; bow down on your knees before Him and glorify Him all night long.
Those people love a fleeting show, and leave a heavy day behind them.
We too have created them and strengthened their sinews. Whenever We wish, We will replace them with others like them in exchange.
This is merely a Reminder; anyone who wishes, may adopt a way to [meet] his Lord.
Anything you (all) wish is only if Allah (God) so wishes too; Allah (God) is Aware, Wise!
He will admit anyone He wishes into His mercy, while He has prepared painful torment for wrongdoers.
