By the Sun and its radiance,
and the moon as it trails after it,
and daylight which shines resplendent from it,
and night when it covers things up,
and the sky and whatever built it,
and the earth and what has stretched it out,
and any soul and whatever has fashioned it
and showed it both its debauchery and its sense of duty!
Anyone who purifies himself will prosper
while whoever neglects to do so will be disappointed.
Thamud rejected it through their arrogance
when their meanest wretch men were delegated [to kill the she-camel]
and Allah (God)'s messenger told them: "[Here is] Allah (God)'s she-camel; give her its day to drink."
They rejected him and killed her, so their Lord snarled at them because of their offence and levelled things off.
He does not fear its outcome!
