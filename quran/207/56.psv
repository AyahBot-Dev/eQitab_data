When the Inevitable (the Day of Resurrection) arrives
no one will deny its happening,
humbling, exalting!
The earth will be rocked with a jolt
and the mountains crumble to pieces
and become dust that is scattered about.
You will form three groups:
the Companions on the Right (What do the Companions on the Right [mean]?);
the Companions on the Left (What do the Companions on the Unlucky side [mean]?);
and the Pioneers will be out there leading!
Those will be the nearest
in gardens of bliss,
a multitude from early men
and a few from later ones
on couches set close together,
leaning back on them, facing one another.
Immortal youths will stroll around them
with glasses, pitchers, and a cup from a fountain
which will not upset them nor dull their senses;
and any fruit that they may choose,
and the meat from any fowl they may desire;
and bright-eyed damsels [chaste]
just like treasured pearls,
as a reward for what they have been doing.
They will not hear any idle talk there nor any fault-finding,
merely people saying: "Peace! Peace!"
The Companions on the Right- how [fortunate] the Companions on the Right!
[They will be] among lote trees trimmed of their thorns,
and bananas piled bunch on bunch,
with their shade spread out,
water pouring forth,
and plenty of fruit
which is neither rationed nor forbidden,
and padded furniture raised [off the floor]. The Inevitable Part 27 535
We have produced special women
and made them (ever) virgins,
easy to get along with and of their same age,
for the Companions on the Right,
a multitude from early men
as well as a multitude from later ones. (II)
The Companions on the Unlucky side, how [misfortunate] the Companions on the Left!
In a scorching wind, scalding water,
and the shade of pitch-black smoke,
which is neither cool nor refreshing.
They had been luxuriating before that happened
and persisted in awesome blasphemy,
and kept on saying: 'When we have died and become dust and bones, will we be raised up again?
Along with our earliest forefathers?"
SAY: "The earlier and the later ones
will be gathered together for an appointment on a well-known day.
Then you mistaken rejectors
will be eating something from the Infernal Tree,
filling (your) bellies with it
and drinking scalding water in addition,
lapping it up, the way thirsty [camels] drink."
Such will be their fare on the Day for Repayment!
We created you, if you would only acknowledge it.
Have you ever considered what you emit [of semen]?
Did you create it, or are We its Creators?
We have ordained death for (all of) you; no one will get ahead to prevent Us
from changing your attributes, and transforming you into something you would never recognize.
You know about the first creation, if you will only recall it.
Have you considered what you plant as crops?
Do you farm it or are We the Farmers?
If We so wished, We would turn it into chaff so you would do nothing but exclaim:
"We are debt-ridden;
in fact, we are destitute!"
Have you ever considered the water you drink?
Do you pour down from the
If We so wished, We might make it brackish. If you would only act grateful!
Have you considered the Fire you kindle?
Are you the ones who grow its trees [for firewood] or are We their Growers?
We have granted it as a Reminder and enjoyment for those living in the wilderness. [or travel]
So celebrate your Lord's almighty name!
Yet I swear by the stars' positions
(it is a serious oath, if you only knew it!)
that it is a Noble Quran
[kept] as a treasured Book
which none but the purified may touch,
something sent down by the Lord of the Universe.
Are you (all) trying to dodge this report?
You reject it in return of [Allah’s(God’s)] giving you means of livelihood!
Why [you can] not [do anything] -when [your soul] leaps to your throat [at death]
and you are then observing,
(We are even Nearer to it than you are, even though you do not notice it)-
provided you are not under any obligation,
return [the soul] back if you are truthful...!
Thus if he is one of those who are drawn close [to Allah(God)]
[he will have] contentment, fragrance, and a garden of bliss-
while if he is one of the Companions on the Right:
"Peace be on you" [will be the greeting) from the Companions on the Right.
However if he is one of the mistaken rejectors
a welcome of scalding water
plus a roasting in Hades [will await him].
This is the absolute Truth;
So celebrate our Lord's almighty name!
