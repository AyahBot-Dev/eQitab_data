He frowned and turned away
because the blind man came to him!
What will make you realize that he may [yet] be purified (of disbelief)
or even reminded, and the Reminder may benefit him?
However anyone who seems indifferent,
you will attend to.
It is not your concern whether he will purify himself (or not)!
Yet with someone who comes to you eagerly
and anxiously,
you act so distracted!
Indeed, it serves as a Reminder!
Anyone who wishes should remember how it
[exists] on honored pages
which are held aloft [for display], cleansed
by the hands of noble,
virtuous scribes.
Let man be damned! What makes him act ungrateful?
From what sort of thing did He create him?
From a drop of semen has He created him and proportioned him.
Then He made the Way easy for him;
next He will let him die and bury him.
Then [later on] He will raise him up again whenever He may wish.
Of course he does not accomplish what He orders him to.
So let man look at his own food!
We let water pour down abundantly;
then We split the earth right open
and cause grain to sprout from it,
and grapes and fodder,
olive trees, date palms
and dense woodlots
and fruit [-trees] and pastures
as an enjoyment for both you and your livestock.
When the uproar comes
on a day when man will flee from his brother,
his mother and his father,
his mate and his children,
every last man among them will have enough concern that day to keep him occupied.
Some faces will be beaming on that day,
laughing, rejoicing;
while other faces will be covered with grime on that day,
soot will overshadow them.
Those will be the shameless disbelievers.
