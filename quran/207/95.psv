By the Figtree and the Olive,
Mount Sinai
and this safe countryside (Mecca),
We have created man with the finest stature;
then reduced him to the dregs on the bottom,
except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds-their earnings shall never be withheld from them.
What would make you reject religion later on?
Is Allah (God) not the Wisest of those who judge?
