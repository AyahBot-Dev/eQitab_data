A skeptic was asking about torment that is bound to happen
to disbelievers; there will be no defence against it
[since it comes] from Allah (God) Who owns the staircases leading upward.
The angels and the Spirit will climb up to Him on a day whose range is fifty thousand years
So act patient with a handsome patience!
They consider it is far away
while We see it as nearby
on a day when the sky will be like molten brass
and the mountains like tufts of yarn.
No close friend will question any [other] friend;
they will merely give each other a knowing look. A criminal might like to ransom himself from that day's torment through his children,
his wife, a brother of his,
his family circle which has sheltered him,
and everyone who is on earth if [such action] might then save him.
Of course not; it would flare up
tugging at his scalp,
claiming anyone who tries to escape and turns away,
through saving (things and wealth) up and hoarding (them).
Man has been created restless,
so he panics whenever any evil touches him,
and withdraws when some good touches him;
except for the prayerful
who are constant at their prayers
and whose wealth comprises an acknowledged responsibility
towards the beggar and the destitute;
and the ones who accept the Day for Repayment,
and those who are apprehensive about their Lord's torment-
their Lord's torment is nothing to feel too safe from!
and the ones who preserve their chastity,
except with their own spouses or those living under their control; with such they are blameless.
Those who desire [to go] beyond that, will be going too far.
and the ones who preserve their trusts and oaths,
and the ones who stand by their testimony,
and the ones who attend to their prayer-
those will be honored in gardens. (ii)
Yet what is wrong with those who disbelieve, that they should try to dash on ahead of you
in batches to the right and on the left?
Does every man among them aspire to enter a Paradise of Bliss?
Of course not! We created them out of something they well know.
And I do swear by the Lord of the Eastern places [of sunrises] and the Western places [of sunrises] that We are Able
to replace them with someone better than they are. We shall never be overruled!
Leave them speculating and playing around until they face their day which they have been promised,
the day when they will hasten forth from their graves as if they were rushing towards some objective,
their eyesight cast down, disgrace overshadowing them on that day which they have been threatened with! 71. Noah
