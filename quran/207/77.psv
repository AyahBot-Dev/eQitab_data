By the [winds] sent forth for a purpose
and gale that rage on and on,
scattering things around;
and by the verses [of Quran] that separates [the wrong from the right],
and [by angels] delivering a Reminder [the Quran]
either as a plea or a warning,
you (all) are surely promised something inevitable.
When the stars fade away,
when the sky splits open,
when mountains are pulverized
and when messengers' time is set,
till which day will they be put off?
Till the day for Sorting [things] out!
What will make you realize what the day for Sorting is?
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
Did We not wipe out ancient men?
Then We followed them up with later ones.
Thus We deal with criminals!
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
Do We not create you (all) from a despised fluid?
We place it in a firm resting place
*( 22) for a known period.
We measure it out and We are the best to measure it!
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
Have We not placed the earth as receptible
for the living and the dead?
We have planted lofty mountains on it and offered you (all) fresh water to drink.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
Hurry off to whatever you have been rejecting!
Hurry away to shade which has three sections,
which is not shady nor any help against flame.
It throws off sparks like a palace [on fire],
[bright] as a yellow camel herd.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
This will be a day when they will not utter [a sound];
nor will they be permitted to offer any excuse.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
This is a day for Sorting [things] out; We shall bring you (all) together with the original men.
If you have any scheme, then scheme against me.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day!
The heedful will be in shady nooks by springs
and have whatever fruit they may hanker for:
"Eat and drink at leisure because of what you have been doing."
Thus We reward those who act kindly.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day.
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, since you are criminals.
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day.
When someone told them: "Bow your heads!", they would not bow their heads [in prayer].
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day.
Yet what revelation after this will they believe in?
