When the sky will split open
and listen to its Lord as it ought to,
suddenly the earth will flatten out,
and throw up whatever it contains, and fall back empty;
and (also) listen to its Lord as it ought to!
Everyman, you are toiling constantly for your Lord, and you will meet Him!
Anyone who is given his record in his right hand
will be called to account with an easy reckoning,
and return joyfully to his family;
while anyone who is given his record behind his back
will appeal to be blotted out
and will roast in the Blaze.
He used to be happy with his own people;
he supposed he would never revert [to Allah (God)].
Nevertheless his Lord had still been Observing him!
So I swear by the gloaming,
and night and whatever it enshrouds,
and the moon when it blossoms full,
you shall ride along stage by stage [in life and hereafter].
What is wrong with them that they do not believe?
When the Quran is read to them, why do they not bow down on their knees?
Instead, those who disbelieve keep on rejecting
while Allah (God) is quite Aware of how they are holding back.
Give them news of painful torment,
except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds; they will have payment which will never be withheld.
