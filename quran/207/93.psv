By the morning bright (forenoon),
and at night when all is still
your Lord has not forsaken you nor is He annoyed.
The Hereafter will be even better for you than the first [life] was.
Your Lord will soon give you something which will leave you satisfied.
Did He not find you an orphan and sheltered [you]?
He found you lost and guided [you].
He found you destitute and made you rich!
Thus the orphan must not be exploited;
and the beggar should not be brushed aside.
Still tell about your Lord's favor.
