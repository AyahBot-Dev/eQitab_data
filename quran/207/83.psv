It will be too bad for cheats [in measure and weight]
who insist on receiving everything when they have people measure something out for them;
yet whenever they measure or weigh things for others, they give (them) less than their due.
Do not such persons suppose they will be raised up again
[to render accounts] on a tremendous day,
a day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe?
Indeed not, the loose-livers' record will be [kept] in a vault.
What will make you realize what such Sijj√Ænis like?
An annotated record!
It will be too bad for rejectors on that day,
those who deny the Day for Repayment!
Each vicious transgressor will plainly reject it;
when Our signs are recited to him, he will say: "[These are] legends by primitive men!"
Of course not; rather whatever they used to do lies like rust on their hearts.
Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on that day;
next they will roast in Hades.
Then someone will say: "This is what you have been rejecting."
Of course the book for the virtuous will rest in the Highest [Heavens].
What will make you realize what the Highest [Heavens] are?
An annotated record
which those closest [to Allah (God)] will bear witness to.
The virtuous will [dwell] in Bliss,
on couches watching.
You will recognize a blissful splendor on their faces.
They will be offered a scaled potion to drink
whose seal will be musk. For that let rivals compete!
It will be blended with a beverage of Tasnim
from a spring where those close [to Allah (God)] will drink.
Those who commit crimes used to laugh at those who believe.
Whenever they pass by them, they nod to one another.
Then when they go back to their own people, they return exultant.
Whenever they see them, they say: "Those (men) are far astray!"
They have not been sent as overseers (to be) set up over them,
so today those who believe will laugh at disbelievers,
from couches where they [lie] watching.
Are not disbelievers being compensated for just what they have been doing? 84. Splitting Open
