Whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth glorifies Allah (God). Control is His and praise is (also) His. He is Capable of everything!
He is the One Who created you so that while one of you may be a disbeliever another of you is still a believer. Allah (God) is Observant of anything and even improved on your shapes. Towards Him lies the Destiny!
He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms; and to Him is the [final] destination.
He knows whatever is in Heaven and Earth, and knows anything you conceal as well as anything you disclose; Allah (God) is Aware of what is on one's mind.
Has not news come to you (all) about those who have disbelieved previously? They tasted the effect of their action and [experienced] painful torment.
That was because their messengers had brought them explanations and yet they said: "Will human beings ever guide us?" So they disbelieved and turned away. Allah (God) has no need of such [people]; Allah (God) is Transcendent, Praiseworthy.
The ones who disbelieve claim they will never be raised up again. SAY: "Indeed, by my Lord, you will be raised again! Then you will be notified about whatever you have been doing. That will be easy for Allah (God) to do!"
Believe in Allah (God) and His messenger, and the Light which We have sent down. Allah (God) is Informed about anything you do.
Some day He will gather you (all) in on the Day of Gathering; that will be the day for haggling! He will remit the misdeeds of anyone who believes in Allah (God) and has acted honorably, and show him into gardens through which rivers flow, to live there forever. That will be the supreme Achievement!
Those who disbelieve and reject Our signs will become inhabitants of the Fire, to remain there. What an awful destiny it is!
No disaster has ever struck anyone unless it was with Allah (God)'s consent. Anyone who believes in Allah (God), has Him to guide his own heart. Allah (God) is Aware of everything.
Obey Allah (God) and obey the Messenger; for if you should turn away, Our messenger needs only to proclaim things clearly.
Allah (God), there is no deity except Him; so on Allah (God) [Alone] let believers rely!
You who believe, some of your spouses and children may be your own enemies, so beware of them! Yet if you pardon, condone and forgive [them], Allah (God) will (likewise) be Forgiving, Merciful.
Your wealth and your children are simply a [means on testing [you]. Yet Allah (God) holds a splendid fee.
Heed Allah (God) however you can manage to; hear, obey and spend money on one another. Those who feel secure from their own soul's grasping, will be successful.
If you will advance Allah (God) a handsome loan, He will compound it for you and forgive you. Allah (God) is Appreciative, Lenient;
Knowing the Unseen and the Visible, [He is] the Powerful, the Wise!
