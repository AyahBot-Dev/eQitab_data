When earth is shaken in her [final) quaking,
and earth throws forth her burdens,
and everyman says: "What is [happening] to her?"
on that day she will report her news
which your Lord has inspired her with.
On that day men will appear in scattered groups to be shown their actions;
and whoever has done an atoms’ weight of good will see it; while whoever has done an atom's weight of evil will see it.
and whoever has done an atoms’ weight of good will see it; while whoever has done an atom's weight of evil will see it.
