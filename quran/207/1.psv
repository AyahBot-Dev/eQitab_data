In the name of Allah (God), the Mercygiving, the Merciful!
Praise be to Allah (God), Lord of the Universe,
the Mercygiving, the Merciful!
Ruler on the Day for Repayment!
You do we worship and You do we call on for help.
Guide us along the Straight Road,
the road of those whom You have favored (prophets, loyal persons, martyrs and honorable men), with whom You are not angry (the Jews), nor who are lost! (the Christians)
