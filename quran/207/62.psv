Whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth glorifies Allah (God) the Sovereign [Who is] the Holy, the Powerful, the Wise!
He is the One Who has dispatched a messenger from the Unlettered [people] among themselves, to recite His verses to them and purify them and teach them the Book (the Quran) and wisdom, even though previously they were in obvious error;
as well as others of them who have not yet joined them. He is the Powerful, the Wise!
Such is Allah (God)'s bounty which He gives to anyone He wishes. Allah (God) possesses splendid bounty!
Those who are laden with the Old Testament, yet do not carry it out may be compared to a donkey who is carrying scriptures. It is such a dreadful way to have to compare people who reject Allah (God)'s signs! Allah (God) does not guide such wrongdoing folk.
SAY: "You who are Jews, if you claim to be Allah (God)'s adherents ahead of [other] people, then long for death if you are so truthful."
They will never long for it because of what their hands have already done. Allah (God) is Aware as to who are wrongdoers.
SAY: "If it is death that you flee, it will still overtake you. Then you will be sent back to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible; He will notify you about whatever you have been doing." ii)
You who believe, when [the call to] prayer is announced on Friday (the day of Congregation). hasten to remember Allah (God) and close your [place of] business. That will be better for you if you only realized it.
Once prayer has been performed, then disperse throughout the land and seek Allah (God)'s bounty. Remember Allah (God) frequently so that you may prosper.
Yet whenever they see some business or some amusement they flock towards it and leave you standing there [alone]. SAY: "Whatever Allah (God) has is better than any amusement or business. Allah (God) is the Best Provider!"
