When the sky bursts apart
when planets are strewn around,
when the seas burst forth,
when graves are overturned,
[each] soul will know what it sent on ahead and has left behind.
O man, what has lured you away from your generous Lord
Who created you, fashioned you and proportioned you
in whatever shape He wished? He has put your frame together.
Nevertheless you still reject religion!
Yet over you (all) [angels] there stand [watching]
some noble guardians, writing it all down;
they know anything you do.
The virtuous shall be in bliss,
while the loose-living will be in Hades;
they shall roast there on the Day for Repayment,
they will never be led out of it.
What will make you realize what the Day for Repayment is?
Again, what will make you realize what the Day for Repayment will be like?
[It is] a day when no soul will control anything in favor of any other soul; Allah (God) [Alone] will hold command on that day!
