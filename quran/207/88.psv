Has the story of the Pall ever reached you?
Some faces will be downcast on that day,
laboring, toiling.
They will roast in a scorching fire;
offered a boiling spring to drink from,
they will have no food except some poisonous thorny plant
which will neither fatten (them) nor satisfy their hunger.
Other faces will be blissful on that day,
pleased with their effort,
(dwelling) in a lofty Paradise.
No loose talk will be heard in it.
There will be a flowing spring there;
by it couches will be raised up,
glasses set in place,
cushions lined up
and carpets spread around.
Do they not consider how camels have been created?
Nor how the sky has been lifted up?
Nor how the mountains have been erected?
Nor even how the earth has been flattened out?
So remind: you need only to remind!
You are no taskmaster set up over them,
except for someone who turns away and disbelieves;
Allah (God) will punish him with the worst torment.
Toward Us lies their retreat;
then their reckoning will fall on Us.
