By the snorting chargers (war horses)
striking sparks [with their hooves]
and raiding by [early] morning,
so they leave a trail of dust
as they dash into the middle of the troops with it;
Man is ungrateful to his Lord!
He himself [acts] as a witness to that;
and is quite passionate in his love of wealth.
Does he not realize that when whatever [lies] in graves is tumbled out,
and whatever is on [people's] minds is checked up on,
their Lord will be Informed about them on that day?
