SAY: "It has been revealed to me that a band of sprites sat listening, and then said: 'We have heard a wonderful Quran
guiding [people] to normal behavior, so we have believed in it. Not one of us will ever associate anyone else with our Lord.
Our Lord's excellence must be exalted! He has taken no consort nor any son.
Some fool among us has been saying outrageous things about Allah (God).
We thought that no human being nor any sprite would ever tell a lie about Allah (God)!'
"Once human men used to take refuge with men from the sprites and it made them do even more transgression.
They thought, just as you have supposed, that Allah (God) will never send anyone up again.
"We reached out for Heaven and found it staffed with stern guards and shooting stars.
We used to squat in some of its seats to listen, though anyone who eavesdrops now finds a shooting star lurking there for him.
We do not know whether evil is intended for anyone on earth, or their Lord wants integrity for them.
Some of us are honorable while others of us are quite the opposite of that: we [travel] along such diverse routes.
"We supposed we would never escape Allah (God) on earth, and we shall never escape Him by fleeing.
When we heard about guidance (the Quran), we trusted it. Anyone who trusts in his Lord needs not fear about being undersold nor caught short.
Some of us are Muslims while others of us are [still] holding back. Those who have committed themselves to (live in) peace are dedicated to integrity;
while those who hold back will become kindling for Hell."
If they would only keep straight along the highway, We will let them drink plenty of water
so We may test them by means of it; while it will lead anyone away to mounting torment who avoids mentioning his Lord.
Mosques belong to Allah (God), so do not appeal to anyone besides Allah (God) (in them).
Yet whenever Allah (God)'s servant stood up to appeal to Him, they almost crowded in upon him!
SAY: "I appeal only to my Lord and never associate anyone else [in my worship of] Him."
SAY: "I do not control any harm for you nor any integrity."
SAY: "No one grants protection from Allah (God) nor will I ever find any sanctuary besides that in Him
except through a decree from Allah (God), and in His message. Anyone who defies Allah (God) and His messenger will have Hell fire to live in forever
until once they see what they have been promised, they will realize who has the weakest supporter and are fewest in numbers."
SAY: "If I only knew whether what you are promised is near, or whether my Lord has set a grace period for it;
Knowing the Unseen, He never discloses his Unseen [secrets] to anyone
except for some messenger whom He approves of. He leads him off with an escort both before him and behind him
so He may know that they have delivered their Lord's messages. He embraces anything that lies in their presence, and calculates everything by means of numbers."
