By the sky holding constellations
and the promised day,
and a witness plus his evidence,
the diggers of the Trench will be slain!
The fire was full of fuel
as they were crouching over it,
and themselves were witnesses of what they were doing to believers.
They persecuted them merely because they believed in Allah (God), the Powerful, the Praiseworthy,
Who holds control over Heaven and Earth. Allah (God) is a Witness for everything!
Those who harass believing men and women, then do not repent, will have Hell's torment; they will have the torment of burning.
The ones who believe and perform honorable deeds will have gardens through which rivers flow; that will be the great Achievement.
Nevertheless your Lord's onslaught will be severe;
He is the One Who originates [matters], then repeats them all over again.
He is the Forgiving, the Affectionate,
Possessor of the Majestic Throne,
Doer of anything He wants.
Has the report on the armies ever come to you,
about Pharaoh and Thamud?
Rather those who disbelieve [persist] in denial
while Allah (God) comes sweeping in behind them [with knowledge of all their actions and deeds].
Still it is a majestic Quran
[preserved] on a Preserved Tablet!
