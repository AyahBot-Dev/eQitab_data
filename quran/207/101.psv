The stunning [blow]!
What is The stunning [blow]?
What will make you realize what is The stunning [blow]?
Some day mankind will act like scattered moths
and the mountains seem like tufts of yarn!
So anyone whose scales are weighted down
[will land] in pleasant living;
while whoever's scales are light
will have a Pit to house him.
What will make you realize what this will be like?
Scorching fire!
