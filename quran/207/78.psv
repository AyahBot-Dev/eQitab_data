What are they questioning one another about?
About an important announcement
which they are disagreeing over.
However they soon will know!
Then indeed they shall know!
Have We not laid the earth out as a cradle
and [set] the mountains up as kingpins?
We have created you in pairs
and granted your sleeping for repose
and granted night as a garment,
and granted daytime for [you to earn your] living in.
We have built seven firmaments (heavens) above you
and set a blazing lamp there.
We send down water in torrents wrung from rainclouds
so We may produce grain and plants with it,
as well as luxuriant gardens.
The day for Sorting has been appointed,
the day when the Trumpet shall be blown so you will come in droves,
and the sky will open up as if it had gates,
and the mountains will travel along as if they were a mirage.
Hell will lurk in ambush
to receive home the arrogant,
who will linger there for ages.
They will taste nothing cool in it nor any drink
except hot bathwater and slops,
[which are such] a fitting compensation
since they have never expected [to meet with] any reckoning
and have wittingly rejected Our signs.
Everything have We calculated in writing:
"So taste! Yet We shall only increase torment for you!"
The heedful will have their scene of triumph
with parks and vineyards,
as well as buxom (mature) maidens their own age
and a brimming cup.
They will hear no idle talk nor any lying [gossip] there,
as a compensation from your Lord, a calculated gift.
Lord of Heaven and Earth as well as whatever is in between them, [He is] the Mercygiving! They control no means of addressing Him;
on the day when the Spirit and the angels will stand there in ranks, only someone the Mercy-giving grants permission to shall speak, and he will speak straight to the point.
That day will seem too real! Anyone who wishes to, may adopt his recourse to [reach] the Lord.
We have warned you (all) how punishment lies close-at-hand, on a day when any man will see whatever his own hands have sent on ahead, and the disbeliever will say: "If I were only dust!"
