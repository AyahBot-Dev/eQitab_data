By the Daybreak
and ten nights
and the even and the odd,
and night as it journeys on,
does that not contain an oath for someone who is mindful?
Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad,
[the people of] Iram, possessing [bodies like] columns
whose like had never been created in the land?
And Thamud who carved rock out of the valley;
and Pharaoh wielding kingpins
who were (all) so arrogant in the land
and increased corruption there?
Your Lord unleashed the scourge of torment on them.
Your Lord is ever on the lookout!
Yet everyman says, whenever his Lord tests him by honoring and favoring him: "My Lord has honored me!";
while whenever He tests him by rationing His sustenance for him, he says: "My Lord has disgraced me."
Rather you are not generous with the orphan
nor do you promote feeding the needy,
and greedily use up anything you inherit.
You love money till it's brimming over!
Indeed when the earth has been completely flattened out
and your Lord comes with the angels, row upon row,
and brings up Hell on that day; on that day everyman will remember, as if remembrance even matters to him!
He will say: "It's too bad for me! What did I send on ahead during my lifetime?"
On that day, no one will torment [anyone] with torment like His,
and no one will hold to any agreement as he will hold to His!
O Tranquil soul,
return to your Lord well pleased and pleasing [Him]!
Enter among My servants,
and. enter My garden.
