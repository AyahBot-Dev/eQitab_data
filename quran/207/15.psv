A. L. R. These are verses from the Book (the Bible), and a clear Quran.
Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to become Muslims.
Leave them eating and enjoying themselves; let hope distract them, for they soon will know (anyhow).
We have never wiped out any town unless it had [received] a known term;
no nation can forestall its deadline, nor will they ever postpone it.
Yet they say: "You to whom the Reminder (the Quran) has been sent down, why you're crazy!
Why don't you bring us angels if you are so truthful?"'
We do not send down any angels except with the Truth, and even then they would not be allowed to wait.
We Ourself have sent down the Reminder (the Quran) just as We are safeguarding it.
Even before you, We sent [some] down among the sects of early people;
yet no messenger ever came to them whom they did not sneer at.
Thus We slip it into criminals' hearts;
they will not believe in it, even though the custom of early people has already preceded it.
Even though We opened up a gate to Heaven for them so they might keep on climbing into it,
they still would say: "Our eyesight has been dazzled-in fact, we are bewitched folk!"
We have placed constellations in the sky and embellished it for onlookers.
We have safeguarded them against every outcast Satan
except for such as may try to eavesdrop, so a blazing meteor follows him.
Earth have We spread out and cast headlands upon it, and planted a bit of everything to grow there (so it is) well balanced.
We have placed various means of livelihood on it for (all of) you as well as anyone you do not have to provide for.
There is nothing whose stores are not [controlled] by Us, and We send it down only according to a fixed quantity.
We send forth fertilizing winds and send down water from the sky and offer you something to drink from it. You are not the ones who store it up.
We give life and bring death, and We are the Heirs [to every- thing]!
We know which of you try to get ahead and We know those who hold back.
Your Lord will summon them; He is Wise, All-Knowing.
We created man from ringing clay, from moulded slime;
while the sprites We had created earlier from smokeless fire.
So your Lord told the angels: "I am about to create a human being from ringing clay, from moulded slime.
When I have finished with him and breathed some of My spirit into him, then drop down on your knees before him."
The angels all bowed down together
except for Diabolis; he refused to be one of those bowing down on their knees.
He said: "Diabolis, what is wrong with you that you are not among those who bow down on their knees?"
He said: "I am no one to kneel before a human being You have created from ringing clay, from moulded slime."
He said: "Then get out of here, for you are an outcast!
On you lies the Curse until the Day for Repayment!"
He said: 'My Lord, let me wait till the day when they are raised up again."
He said: "You will be allowed to wait
until the Appointed Day."
He said: "My Lord, since You have let me go astray, I shall make things on earth seem attractive to them; I'll mislead them all
except for any of Your sincere servants who may be among them."
He said: "Here will be a Straight Road [leading] up to Me!
You will not hold any authority over My servants except for someone who may follow you from among those who are misguided.
Hell will [serve as] an appointment for all of them together.
It has seven gates; each gate will have a portion assigned from them."
The heedful will be in gardens and by springs:
"Enter them safely, at peace!"
We will strip away any rancor that [lingers] in their hearts; like brothers they will face one another on couches.
Toil will not touch them there, nor will they ever be expelled from it.
Advise My servants that I am the Forgiving, Merciful One,
although My torment will be painful torment.
Advise them about Abraham's guests
how, when they entered his presence and said: "Peace!", he said: "We feel wary of you."
They said: 'Don't feel so wary; We bring you word about a knowledgeable boy."
He said: "Have you brought me word like this once old age has set in on me? What sort of word do you want to spread?"
They said: "We have brought you word of the Truth, so do not act so discouraged."
He said: "Who despairs of his Lord's mercy except those who are lost?"
He said: "Yet what is your errand, you emissaries?"
They said: "We have been sent for some criminal folk,
except for Lot's house; we will rescue them all
except his wife. We have decreed that she will be one of those who will be left behind."
When the emissaries came to Lot's household,
he said: "You are folk who should be ignored."
They said: Rather we have come to you about something they have been puzzling over.
We have brought you the Truth, for we are reliable.
Travel with your family at dead of night; you should follow in their rear, and let none of you glance around! Keep on going wherever you are ordered to.

The people of the city came up joyful with the news.
He said: "These are my guests so do not disgrace me.
Heed Allah (God), and do not shame me."
They said: "Didnâ€™t we forbid you to have contact with [anyone in] the Universe [outside]?"'
He said: "These are my daughters [for marriage] if you are going to do (something)."
Upon your life, they were groping along in their drunkenness
so the Blast caught them at sunrise:
We turned things upside down and rained down stones which had been dried in fire.
In that are signs for investigators;
and it lies along a permanent highway.
In that is a sign for believers.
The Companions in the Forest had been wrongdoers,
so We avenged Ourself on them. Both are a clear indication. (VI)
The inhabitants of Stoneland rejected the emissaries.
We gave them Our signs even though they had shunned them.
They had confidently hewn houses out of the mountains.
So the Blast caught them early one morning
and what they had been earning did not help them out.
We have only created Heaven and Earth and whatever lies between them except with justice. The Hour is coming on, so forgive with gracious forgiveness.
Your Lord is the Clever Creator!
We have brought you seven Oft-Repeated [verses] plus the Mighty Qur`an.
Do not strain your eyes towards what We let some types of them [disbelievers] enjoy; do not feel saddened by them, and lower your [sheltering] wing over believers.
SAY:"I am the plain Warner,"
such as We have sent down for the dividers [who divided the Quran into acceptable and unacceptable parts].
who have torn the Quran apart.
By your Lord, We shall question them all
about whatever they have been doing!
So proclaim whatever you are ordered to, and shun associators;
We will suffice for you against such scoffers
who place another deity alongside Allah (God) [Alone], They soon will know!
We already know how cramped your heart feels because of what they say:
so hymn your Lord's praise and be one of those who bow down on their knees (in worship).
Serve your Lord until conviction comes to
