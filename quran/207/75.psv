I do swear by Resurrection Day,
as I swear by the rebuking soul,
does man think We shall never gather his bones together [again]?
Of course We are Capable of reshaping even his fingertips.
Yet man wants to commit sins right out in the open.
He asks: "When will Resurrection Day be ?"
When one's sight is dazzled,
and the moon is eclipsed,
as the sun and moon are brought together,
on that day (every) man will say: "Where is there any escape?"
Of course there will be no sanctuary;
recourse will be only with your Lord on that day.
Man will be notified that day about anything he has sent on ahead or else held back.
Indeed man holds evidence even against himself
although he may proffer his excuses.
Do not try to hurry it up with your tongue;
it is up to Us to collect it, as well as [to know how] to recite it.
So whenever We do read it, follow in its reading;
it is then
Indeed how you (all) love the fleeting present
while you neglect the Hereafter!
Some faces will be radiant on that day,
looking toward their Lord;
while other faces will be scowling on that day,
thinking that some impoverishing blow will be dealt them.
Indeed when it reaches as high as one's collarbone
and someone says: "Who is such a wizard?",
he will suppose that it means leave-taking
while one shin will twist around the other shin [to keep it from moving];
towards your Lord will the Drive be on that day!
He was not believing and did not pray,
but said: "No!" [to the truth] and turned away.
Then he stalked off haughtily to his family,
[though] closer to you and even closer!
Then closer to you [lies your doom] and still closer!
Does man think he'll be left neglected [without punishment]?
Was he not once a drop of ejected semen?
Then he became a clot, so [Allah (God)] created and fashioned [him]
and made him into two sexes, male and female.
Is such a Being not Able to revive the dead?
