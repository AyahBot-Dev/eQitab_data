O Prophet, heed Allah (God) and do not obey disbelievers and hypocrites. Allah (God) is All-Knowing, Wise.
Follow whatever you are inspired with by your Lord; Allah (God) is Informed about what you (all) are doing.
Rely on Allah (God); Allah (God) suffices as a Trustee.
Allah (God) has not placed two hearts in any man's body. Nor has He granted you wives whom you may back away from, to act as your mothers, nor has He granted your adopted sons to be your own sons. That is your own statement made by your own mouths. Allah (God) states the Truth and He guides one along the Way.
Call them after their own fathers; it is fairer so far as Allah (God) is concerned. If you do not know who their fathers were, then [call them] your brothers in religion and your associates. What you may have slipped up on already will not be held against you, but only something your hearts have done intentionally. Yet Allah (God) is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Prophet is closer to believers than even they themselves are, and his wives are [like] their mothers. Yet blood relatives are closer to one another in Allah (God)'s book than are believers and the Refugees, except that you should act in a proper manner towards your associates. That has been underlined in the [Sacred] Book.
When We made an agreement with the prophets, with you and with Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus the son of Mary, We pledged a solemn agreement with them
so He might question sincere persons concerning their sincerity. He has prepared painful torment for disbelievers!
You who believe, remember Allah (God)'s favor upon you when the armies charged at you! We sent a wind and even armies you did not see against them. Allah (God) was Observant of what you were doing,
as they came at you both from above you and from below you, and your eyesight faltered and your hearts leaped up into your throats, and you entertained certain thoughts about Allah (God);
there believers were tested and severely shaken as if in an earthquake.
Thus hypocrites and those whose hearts contain malice said: "Allah (God) and His messenger have only promised us something to lure us on."
So when a faction of them said: "O people of Yathrib, there is no room for you, so return!", a group of them took leave of the Prophet, saying: "Our houses lie exposed." They were not defenceless; they merely wanted to run away.
If a raid had been made on them from [all] its quarters, then they had been asked to rise up in dissension, they would have done so and yet not lasted very long.
Still they had already pledged to Allah (God) that they would not turn their backs! Any oath [made] to Allah (God) will be asked about.
SAY: "Fleeing will never help you: if you should flee from death or slaughter, then you will still enjoy (life) only briefly."
SAY: "Who is there to shield you from Allah (God) if He should want any ill for you or wants mercy for you?" They will find they have no patron nor any supporter besides Allah (God).
Allah (God) knows the meddlers among you and the ones telling their brothers: "Come over to our side!" They only take part in conflict for a little while,
skimping towards you (all). Whenever fear comes over them, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling around like someone whom death has almost seized. Once fear leaves them. they will lash out at you (all) with [their] sharp tongues, yet skimping about [doing] any good. Those persons do not believe, so Allah (God) has foiled their actions. That is so easy for Allah (God) [to do].
They think the Coalition will not go away. If the Coalition should come [again], they would like to be wandering around far away among the [desert] Arabs, asking for news about you. Yet even if they were among you, they would only fight a little.
In Allah (God)'s messenger you have a fine model for someone who looks forward to [meeting] Allah (God) and the Last Day, and mentions Allah (God) frequently.
When believers saw the Coalition, they said: 'This is what Allah (God) and His messenger have promised us. Allah (God) and His messenger have told the truth." It merely increased them in faith and submission.
Some believers are men who are sincere in what they pledge to Allah (God), while others have already fulfilled their mortal duty, and still others are waiting [their chance]; they have not changed in the least,
so Allah (God) may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish hypocrites if He so wishes, or else relent towards them. Allah (God) is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah (God) sent the ones who disbelieved back in their fury; they did not accomplish any good. Allah (God) spares believers the trouble of fighting; Allah (God) is Strong, Powerful!
He has tossed some People of the Book (the Bible) who had backed them up, out of their strongholds and cast panic into their hearts; one group you killed while you captured another group.
He let you inherit their land, their homes and their property, plus a land you have not yet set foot on. Allah (God) is Capable of everything!
O Prophet, tell your wives: "If you are wanting worldly life and its attraction, then come on! I'll let you enjoy them and dismiss you in a handsome fashion.
However if you have been wanting [to see] Allah (God) and His messenger, as well as having a home in the Hereafter, well Allah (God) has prepared splendid payment for the kindly women among you.
O wives of the Prophet, anyone of you who commits some flagrant act of misconduct shall have [her] punishment doubled twice over. That is easy for Allah (God) [to do].
"Yet We will give any of you who is devoted to Allah (God) and His messenger, and acts honorably, her earnings twice over. We have reserved a generous provision for her.
O wives of the Prophet, you are not like any other women! If you do your duty, then do not act too deferential while talking [to others] lest someone whose heart contains malice may thereby be encouraged. Employ suitable speech.
Remain in your homes and do not dress up fancily the way they used to dress during [the time of] primitive Ignorance. Keep up prayer and pay the Zakat (welfare tax), and obey Allah (God) and His messenger. Allah (God) merely wants to remove any blight from you [since you are] People of the [Prophet's] House, and to cleanse you thoroughly.
Remember any of Allah (God)'s verses and wisdom which are recited in your homes. Allah (God) is Gracious, Informed."
Muslim men and Muslim women, believing men and believing women, devout men and devout women, truthful men and truthful women, patient men and patient women, reverent men and reverent women, charitable men and charitable women, fasting men and fasting women, and men who safeguard their private parts and women who safeguard [theirs], and men who remember Allah (God) often and women who remember [Him]-for [all of] them Allah (God) has prepared forgiveness and a splendid wage.
No believing man nor any believing woman should exercise any choice in their affair once Allah (God) and His messenger have decided upon some matter. Anyone who disobeys Allah (God) and His messenger has wandered off into manifest error.
Thus you told someone whom Allah (God) had favored [by being a Muslim] and whom you yourself have favored [by feeing him]: "Hold on to your wife, and heed Allah (God)," while you kept to yourself what Allah (God) had disclosed [that Zaid will divorce her and you will marry her] and you dreaded people['s opinion], although it is more correct for you to dread Allah (God). Once Zayd had ended his [marital] relationship with her, We married her off to you so that there would be no objection for believers in respect to their adopted son's wives once they have divorced them. Allah (God)'s command must be done!
The Prophet is not to be reproached for [doing] what Allah (God) has stipulated for him to do. Allah (God)'s practice has been such with those who have passed on already-Allah (God)'s command is a pre-ordained decree
for those who transmit Allah (God)'s messages and dread him, while they do not dread anyone else than Allah (God). Allah (God) suffices as a Reckoner.
Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] Allah (God)'s messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. Allah (God) is Aware of everything!
You who believe, remember Allah (God) often.
Glorify Him morning and evening;
He is the One Who accepts prayers from you, as do His angels, to lead you out of darkness into Light. He is Merciful with believers.
Their greeting on the day they meet Him will be: "Peace!" He has prepared generous payment for them.
O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness, herald and warner,
and as someone who invites people to [know] Allah (God) by His permission, and as a shining lamp.
Proclaim to believers how they will have great bounty from Allah (God).
Do not obey disbelievers and hypocrites, Disregard their annoyance and rely on Allah (God): Allah (God) suffices as a Trustee.
You who believe, whenever you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have touched them, you have no number [of months] to count in their case. Provide for them and release them in a handsome manner.
O Prophet, We have permitted you [to deal with] your wives whom you have given their bridewealth to, and anyone your right hands control (any slaves) from what Allah (God) has furnished you [as captives], and your paternal uncles' and aunts' daughters, and your maternal uncles' and aunts' daughters who have migrated along with you, and any believing woman who bestows herself upon the Prophet, provided the Prophet wants to marry her; such is exclusively for you and not for [other] believers. We know what We have stipulated for them concerning their wives and anyone their right hands control (slaves), so it will not be held against you. Allah (God) is Forgiving, Merciful.
You may make any one of them you wish wait, and let any one you wish approach you. It will not be held against you concerning anyone you may desire among those whom you have set aside. That is more suitable so that you may comfort them and they will not be saddened, and [instead] pleased with anything you may give them all. Allah (God) knows what is in your hearts; Allah (God) is Aware, Lenient.
No [other] women will be lawful for you later on nor may you exchange them for other wives, even though their beauty may entice you, except for someone your right hand controls [of female slaves]. Allah (God) is an Observer over everything.
You who believe, do not enter the Prophet's [private] quarters unless an invitation has been extended to you for a meal, though still without waiting for it to be prepared. However once you have been invited, then go on in; and once you have been fed, then disperse, not indulging in conversation. That has been disturbing the Prophet and he feels ashamed [to tell] you so. Yet Allah (God) is not ashamed [to raise] the Truth. Whenever you ask (his wives) for any object, ask them for it from behind a curtain. That will be purer for your hearts as well as for their hearts. It is not proper for you to annoy Allah (God)'s messenger, nor ever to marry his wives after him; that would be serious with Allah (God)!
Whether you reveal anything or hide it, Allah (God) is Aware of everything.
There is no objection to their [appearing before] their fathers, their sons nor their brothers, nor their brothers' and sisters' sons, nor their [Muslim] womenfolk, nor anyone their right hands control [of female slaves]. Heed Allah (God) (you women); Allah (God) is a Witness for everything!
Allah (God) and His angels bless the Prophet. You who believe, pray for him (too) and greet him properly.
Allah (God) will curse those who [try to] annoy Allah (God) and His messenger in this world and the Hereafter, and will prepare shameful torment for them.
Those who annoy believing men and believing women without their having deserved it, will assume [the guilt of] slander and [commit] a clear offence against themselves.
O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and believers' wives as well, to draw their cloaks close around themselves. That is more appropriate so they may be recognized and not molested. Allah (God) is Forgiving, Merciful.
If hypocrites and those whose hearts contain malice do not stop, as well as the agitators in Madina, We shall stir you up against them. Then they will live alongside you as neighbors for only a little while [longer];
cursed wherever they are encountered, they will be seized and completely killed.
[Such is] Allah (God)'s practice with those who have passed on before; you will never find any change in Allah (God)'s practice.
People will ask you about the Hour. SAY: "Knowledge about it rests only with Allah (God)." What will make you realize that perhaps the Hour is near!
Allah (God) curse disbelievers and prepare a Blaze for them
to remain in for ever. They will not find any patron nor supporter;
on a day when their faces will be twisted by the Fire, they will say: "If we had only obeyed Allah (God) and obeyed the Messenger!"
They will (also) say: "Our Lord, we have obeyed our superiors and our great men, and they led us off from the Way.
Our Lord, give them double torment and curse them with a great curse!"
You who believe, do not be like those who abused Moses. But Allah (God) cleared him of what they said. He became outstanding with Allah (God).
You who believe, heed Allah (God) and speak straight to the point;
He will improve your actions for you and forgive you your sins. Anyone who obeys Allah (God) and His messenger will achieve a splendid Triumph.
We offered the trust to Heaven and Earth, and to the mountains too, yet they refused to carry it, and shrank back from it. However man accepted it: he has been unfair [to himself], ignorant!
Still Allah (God) will punish hypocritical men and hypocritical women and associating men and associating women. However Allah (God) relents with believing men and believing women. Allah (God) is Forgiving, Merciful!
