Glorify the name of your Lord, the All-Highest,
Who has created and fashioned,
Who has proportioned and guided,
Who brings forth pasturage,
then turns it into weather-beaten stubble.
We shall make you recite, so do not forget [anything]
except whatever Allah (God) may wish; He knows the obvious and what is hidden.
We will make it easy for you to take the easy way,
so remind [men], if reminding will benefit [anyone].
Anyone who feels afraid will be reminded
while the unluckiest will avoid it,
the one who will roast in the greatest Fire, shunts it aside;
then he will neither die in it, nor yet live there.
Anyone who purifies himself,
mentions his Lord's name and prays, will prosper.
Instead you prefer worldly life
whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
This has been [written] on the earliest scrolls,
the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
