I swear by [this] countryside (Mecca),
you are a native settled on this land
as well as any parent and whatever he may father.
We have created man under stress.
Does he think that no one can do anything against him?
He says: "I have used up piles of money!"
Does he consider that no one sees him?
Have We not granted him both eyes,
a tongue and two lips,
and guided him along both highroads [good and evil]?
Yet he does not tackle the [road with] Obstacle!
What will make you realize what the Obstacle is?
[It means] redeeming the captive,
or feeding
some orphaned relative on a day of famine
or some needy person in distress.
Then he will act like someone who believes, recommends patience and encourages mercifulness.
Those will be the companions on the right-hand side,
while the ones who disbelieve in Our signs will be companions on the sinister side:
above them a fire will hem them in
