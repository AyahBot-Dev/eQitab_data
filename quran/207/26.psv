T.S.M.
These are verses from the Clear Book (the Quran).
Perhaps you are fretting your soul away because they are not believers.
If We so wished, We might send a sign down to them from Heaven so they would bow their heads submissively before it.
No Reminder ever comes to them as a renewal from the Mercygiving except they shun it.
They have just rejected [it], so news of what they have been ridiculing will soon come to them.
Have they not looked at the earth [to see] how many generous species We have grown on it?
In that is a sign; though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful. (II)
So your Lord summoned Moses: "Go to the wrongdoing folk,
Pharaoh's folk! Will they not heed?"
He said: "My Lord, I fear they will reject me,
and my breast feels cramped while my tongue will not loosen up. Send for Aaron!
They have [laid] a charge against me; so I fear they will kill me."
He said; "Indeed not; let both of you go off with Our signs, We will be listening along with you.
Go to Pharaoh and say: "We are messengers from the Lord of the Universe.
Send the Children of Israel off with us!"'
He said: "Did we not rear you as a child among us and you spent several years of your life with us?
Yet you committed the deed you did: You are so ungrateful!"
He said: "I did it while I was misguided.
I fled from you (all) because I feared you. Still my Lord has bestowed discretion on me and set me up as an emissary.
Is this some favor you have shown me-that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?"'
Pharaoh said: "What is the Lord of the Universe?"
He said: "The Lord of Heaven and Earth and whatever [lies] in between them, if you will be convinced."
He said to those around him: "Aren’t you listening?"
He said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your very first forefathers,"
He said: "Your messenger who has been sent to you is crazy!"
He said: "[He comes from] the Lord of the East and West, and whatever lies in between them, if you know how to reason."
He said: "If you should adopt any god besides me, I shall make you a prisoner."
He said: "Even if I bring you something obvious?"
He said: "Bring it, if you a telling the truth!"
So he cast his staff down and, it was clearly a snake!
He pulled out his hand [from his shirtfront], and, it was white to the spectators! (III)
He told the councilmen around him: "This is some clever magician
who wants to drive you out of your land through his magic. What do you order?"
They said: "Make him and his brother wait, and send recruiters out into the cities
who will bring you in every clever magician."
So the magicians were gathered for the appointment on a certain day,
and the people were told: "Are you assembling
so that we may follow the sorcerers once they have won out?"
When the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh: "Will we have payment if we are the winners?"
He said: "Yes, you will then become courtiers."
Moses told them: "Throw down whatever you are going to throw.'
So they threw their ropes and their staffs, and said: " By Pharaoh's majesty, we will be the winners!"
So Moses cast his staff and imagine, it swallowed up what they were shamming about!
The sorcerers dropped down on their knees;
they said: "We believe in the Lord of the Universe,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron!"
He said. "Have you believed in Him before I permit you to? He is your chief who has taught you magic. You will know! I'll cut your hands and feet off on opposite sides and crucify you all!"
They said: 'It won’t hurt! We will be sent home to our Lord;
we long for our Lord to forgive us our mistakes so we may be the first among believers." (IV)
We inspired Moses as follows: "Travel with My servants at night: you will be pursued!"
Pharaoh sent recruiters into the cities:
"Those are a few dissidents;
they are agitating against us.
We are completely forewarned."
Yet We drove them out of (their) gardens and springs,
treasures and a splendid position.
The same We let the Children of Israel fall heirs to.
They followed after them at sunrise.
When both groups sighted each other, Moses' companions said: "We have been overtaken!"
He (Moses) said: "Not at all! My Lord stands by me; He will guide me!"
So We inspired Moses as follows: "Strike the sea with your staff!" If opened up and each section was like a huge cliff.
We brought the others up next,
and saved Moses and all those who were with him.
Then We let the rest drown.
In that is a sign; though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful.
Recite Abraham's news to them
when he said to his father and his folk: "What are you worshipping?"
They said; "We worship idols, and are utterly devoted to them."
He said; "Do they hear you when you call,
or benefit you or harm [you]?"
They said: "Rather we found our fathers doing so."
He said: "Have you ever seen what you have been worshipping,
you and your forefathers, the old-timers?
They are enemies of mine, except for the Lord of the Universe
Who created me. He guides me
and is the One Who feeds me and gives me something to drink.
Whenever I fall ill, He heals me;
[He is] the One Who will cause me to die, then bring me back to life [again];
the One Who I expect will forgive me my mistakes on the Day for Repayment.
"My Lord, bestow discretion on me and acquaint me with honorable men!
Grant me a truthful reputation among later men,
Grant me an inheritance in the Garden of Bliss.
Forgive my father even though he may be [considered] lost.
Do not disgrace me on the day they are raised up again,
the day when neither wealth nor children will benefit anyone
except for someone who comes to Allah (God) with a sound heart." Doomsday
The Paradise will be brought near the headful;
while Hades will appear for the straying
and they were told "Where is whatever you were worshiping
instead of Allah (God)? Will they support you, or even support themselves?
So they will be toppled into it, both they and the misguided ones,
as well as all of Diabolis' armies.
They will say while they quarrel away in it:
"By Allah (God), we were in such obvious misguidance
when we put you (all) on the same footing as the Lord of the Universe!
It has only been criminals who have led us astray;
We have no intercessors
nor any bosom friend.
If we had another chance, we would then be believers!"
In that is a sign, though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful. Noah
Noah's folk rejected the emissaries
when their brother Noah said to them: "Will you not do your duty?
I am a trustworthy messenger for you,
so heed Allah (God) and obey me.
I do not ask you for any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe.
So heed Allah (God) and obey me!"
They said: "Are we to believe in you while the inferior people follow you?"
He said: "What knowledge do I have about what they have been doings
Their reckoning is only by my Lord, if you will only notice it!
I do not intend to drive any believers away;
I am merely a plain warner."
They said: "If you do not stop, Noah, you will become an outcast."
He said: "My Lord, my folk have rejected me!
Decide the case between me and them, and rescue me as well as any believers who may be with me!"
So We rescued him and anyone who was with him on the laden ship.
Then later on We let those who remained drown.
In that is a sign, though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful!
Ad rejected the emissaries
when their brother Hud said to them; "Will you not do our duty?
I am a trustworthy messenger for you,
so heed Allah (God) and obey me.
I do not ask you for any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe.
"Are you building a monument on every hill just so you may fool around?
Are you setting up castles so that you may live for ever?
Whenever you assault anyone, you pounce on them like bullies.
So heed Allah (God) and obey me;
heed the One Who has furnished you with whatever you know.
He has furnished you with livestock and children,
gardens and springs.
Yet I fear the torment of a terrible day for you!"
They said: "It's all the same for us whether you lecture [us] or are not lecturing.
This is only a fabrication [made up] by primitive men;
we are not going to be punished.
They rejected him, so We wiped them out. In that is a sign; though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful!"
Thamud rejected the emissaries
when their brother Salih said to them: "Will you not do your duty?
I am a trustworthy messenger for you,
so heed Allah (God) and obey me.
I do not ask you for any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe.
"Will you be left securely in what you have here,
among gardens and springs,
crops and date palms with slender stalks?
You skillfully hew houses out of the mountains.
Heed Allah (God) and obey me;
do not obey the order of extravagant people
who corrupt [things] on earth and never reform."
They said: "You are merely someone deluded;
you are only a human being like ourselves! Bring a sign if you are so truthful."
He said: "This is a she-camel. She has drinking rights while you have drinking rights on a fixed day.
Do not touch her so that you hurt her, lest the torment of an awful day may seize you!"
Yet they mistreated her, and one morning they felt remorseful about it.
Torment overtook them. In that is a sign, though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful.
Lot's folk rejected the emissaries
when their brother Lot said to them: "Will you not do your duty?
I am a trustworthy messenger [sent] to you,
so heed Allah (God) and obey me.
I do not ask you any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe.
Do you approach males among [everyone in] the Universe,
and ignore any wives whom your Lord has created for you? Indeed you are such defiant folk!"
They said; "If you do not stop, Lot, you will become an exile."
He said: "I am someone who detests your behavior.
My Lord, save me and my family from what they are doing!"
So We saved him and his whole family
except for an old woman among those who stayed behind.
Then We annihilated the rest;
We sent a rain down upon them. How evil was such a rain for those who had been warned!
In that is a sign; though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful.
The dwellers in the Forest rejected the emissaries
when Shuayb said to them: "Will you not perform your duty?
I am a trustworthy messenger [sent] to you,
so heed Allah (God) and obey me!
I do not ask you for any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe.
"Give full measure and do not cause [people] any losses.
Weigh with honest scales;
do not undersell people to cheat them of their things nor storm around the earth in order to spoil matters.
Heed Him Who created you and the character of the earliest men."
They said: "You are merely someone bewitched.
You are only a human being like ourselves, and we think you are a liar.
Let a piece fall out of the sky on us if you are so truthful."
He said: "My Lord is quite Aware of what you are doing."
So they rejected him, and the torment of a gloomy day gripped them; it was the torment of a terrible day!
In that is a sign, though most of them are not believers.
Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful!
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe.
The Faithful Spirit has brought it down
for your heart, so may be a warner
in a clear Arabic tongue.
It [can be found] in the Psalms of early men.
Do they not have a sign since the scholars among Children of Israel knew about it?
If We had sent it down to some outsider [of Arab]
and he had read it to them [perfecty], they would never have believed in it.
We slip it[s hate] into criminals' hearts.
They will not believe in it until they see painful torment;
it will come upon them suddenly while they least suspect it,
and so they say: "Will we be allowed to wait?"
Are they trying to hasten up Our torment?
Have you seen how We let them enjoy themselves for years,
then whatever they have been threatened with, comes to them?
Whatever they have been enjoying will never benefit them.
We never wipe out any town unless it has had its warners
to remind [it]. We have never been unfair.
The devils did not descend with it:
it does not suit them to, nor can they manage it;
they are too withdrawn to even hear it.
Do not appeal to any other deity along with Allah (God), lest you be tormented.
Warn your nearest kinfolk;
lower your [protecting] wing over any believers who may follow you.
If they opposed you, then SAY: "I am innocent of whatever doing."
Rely on the Powerful, the Merciful
Who sees you whenever you stand up [in prayer]
as well as how you move around among those who are bowing down on their knees.
He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Shall I tell you who are the ones on whom the devils descend?
They come down upon every bluffing sinner.
They even try to eavesdrop, since most of them are liars;
and poets are followed around by the bewildered.
Do you not see them staggering around in every river-valley?
They preach what they never practise,
except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds, remember Allah (God) often, and protect themselves [and believers] once they have been wronged. Those who do wrong shall know what sort of upsets they may expect to face!
