READ in the name of your Lord Who creates,
creates man from a clot!
READ, for your Lord is most Generous;
[it is He] Who teaches by means of the pen,
teaches man what he does not know.
However, man acts so arrogant,
for he considers he is self-sufficient.
Yet to your Lord will be the Return!
Have you seen someone who stops
a worshipper as he prays?
Have you considered whether he is [looking] for guidance
or ordering heedfulness?
Have you seen whether he has rejected [the message] and turned away?
Does he not know that Allah (God) sees [everything]?
Of course not! Yet if he does not stop, We shall catch him by his forelock!
Such a lying, sinful forelock!
Let him appeal to his henchmen:
We shall appeal to the avenging [angels].
Of course, do not obey him; bow down on your knees, and come closer!
