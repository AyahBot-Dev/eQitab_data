When the sun has been extinguished,
when the stars slip out of place,
when the mountains travel along,
when ten-month pregnant camels are neglected,
when wild beasts are herded together,
when the seas overflow,
when souls are reunited [with similar ones],
when the buried girl is asked
for what offence she has been killed,
when scriptures are unrolled,
when the sky is stripped bare,
when Hades is set blazing,
when the Paradise is brought close,
each soul shall know what it has prepared!
So I swear by the planets [that recede]
and the ones that are moving, sweeping along,
and night as it draws on,
and morning when it breathes again,
it is a statement by a generous messenger
possessing strength established by the One Enthroned
Who is to be Obeyed and more than that is Trustworthy.
Your companion is not crazy!
He saw him on the clear horizon;
nor was he grudging about the Unseen.
Nor is it a statement [made] by some outcast Satan.
So where are you (all) heading for?
It is merely a Reminder to [everyone in] the Universe.
So anyone of you who wishes may go straight.
Yet you will only wish whatever Allah (God), Lord of the Universe, may wish. Burning Apart Part 30 587
